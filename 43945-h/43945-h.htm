<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>The foundations of this work were laid by my endeavours to
understand what is perhaps the most complicated and obscure
series of statutes in the statute book. In working from time to
time at the Law of Copyright I found great want of a text-book
which should be exhaustive of the case law, and at the
same time contain a concise and clearly arranged epitome
of the statutory provisions. This want I have tried to supply
for myself in the present compilation, and it is now published
in the hope that it may prove useful to others. The present
law is bad both in substance and form, but it is the more
essential that those who have anything to do with literary or
artistic property should comprehend it in so far as it is comprehensible.
There are probably more pitfalls for the unwary
in dealing with Copyright than with any other branch of the
law.</p>

<p>We have for some time been on the eve of a general
codification and amendment of the Law of Copyright. It
is, however, an eve of long and indefinite duration. It is
now twenty-eight years since the Royal Commission on Copyright
was appointed, and still nothing has been done to
ameliorate the lamentable condition in which the Commissioners
then found the law. Dissensions among those
who are interested in Copyright, failure to come to a satisfactory
arrangement with the colonies, and want of time at
the disposal of the legislature are mainly responsible for this
delay. In the meantime it is well that all those who are
interested in Copyright should make themselves conversant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
with the law as it now is, so that when the time for legislation
does at last come the result may be the more
satisfactory.</p>

<p>I have added to this work Part II., dealing with Copyright
in the United States, and I hope it may prove useful not
only to English but to American lawyers and publishers.</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge much assistance in the preparation
of this work and many invaluable suggestions from my
friends, Mr. Langridge, of the Middle Temple, and Mr.
Mackinnon, of the Inner Temple.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>

<p>The history of copyright has been exhaustively dealt with by
Mr. Copinger, Mr. Scrutton, and Mr. Drone in their respective
treatises on copyright law. I feel that I can add nothing useful
to this branch of the subject, and as a detailed account of the
evolution of the law of literary and artistic property is of little
value to the practitioner except as academic knowledge, I propose
merely to pass briefly in review the various epochs through
which the author and his publisher have passed in their
struggle to obtain from the public what they consider to be
the just and adequate remuneration for their labours. For
a complete historical introduction to the law of copyright
I cannot do better than refer to Mr. Birrell's delightful
lectures.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Royal
Prerogative.</div>

<p>The first record which we have of any monopoly in the
reproduction of literary work is in the exercise of the alleged
prerogative of the Crown to control the printing-press. No
book whatsoever was allowed to be printed without a licence
or grant of monopoly from the Crown. One of the principal
objects in the exercise of this prerogative was the prevention
of the dissemination of religious doctrines contrary to the
accepted faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Company
of
Stationers.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Star
Chamber.</div>

<p>Henry VIII. created the Company of Stationers to supervise
and control the publication of books. This company made
various rules and regulations as to the printing of books, and
from them licences could be obtained by an author to print his
copy. The Stationers' Company was first incorporated in the
reign of Philip and Mary in 1556. The Crown enforced its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
prerogative and the rules of the Stationers' Company by means
of the Court of Star Chamber, which from time to time passed
various decrees, and punished offenders by fine and imprisonment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The germ
of Copyright.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Licences.</div>

<p>By this means the Crown until 1640 exercised an unlimited
jurisdiction over the press. In this there was no recognition
of a right of property in the author of a work, but
merely an enforcement of the royal prerogative to control the
press. Incidentally, however, a kind of property sprang up,
since the Stationers' Company in granting licences recognised
the right of the author or his assignee to his copy. Licences
were granted to those who showed that they had a right in
the manuscript, and all others were prohibited from infringing
the monopoly. An entry in the records of the Stationers'
Company in 1562, for instance, enacts "That if it be found
any other has a right to any of the copies, then the licence
touching such of the copies so belonging to another shall be
void."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Long
Parliament.</div>

<p>When the Star Chamber was abolished in 1640 the two
Houses made an ordinance prohibiting printing unless the book
was first licensed and entered in the register of the Stationers'
Company, and further prohibiting printing without the consent
of the owner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Licensing
Statute.</div>

<p>At the Restoration a licensing statute<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> was passed similarly
prohibiting printing without licence and without the consent of
the owner. The statute finally expired in 1694.</p>

<p>On the expiry of the licensing statute, authors and publishers
thought that all protection for literary work was gone,
and made strenuous efforts for new legislation. Bills were
brought into Parliament in 1703 and 1706, and finally in
1709 the copyright statute of Anne became law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8 Anne,
c. 19.
The beginning
of
Statutory
Copyright.</div>

<p>The Act of Anne created for the first time a statutory property
in books. The author of any book and his assignee or
assigns were given the sole liberty of printing and reprinting
such book for the term of fourteen years from publication
"and no longer," and if at the end of that period the author
was still living, then such right returned to the author for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
another term of fourteen years. The Act provided that an
offender should forfeit pirated copies and sheets to the proprietor
of the copyright, who was enjoined to "forthwith damask
and make waste paper of them." The Act further imposed
a penalty of one penny for every sheet found in the offender's
possession, one half of the penalties to go to the Crown and
the other half to any person who should sue for the same. The
Act made registration in the Register Book of the Company of
Stationers before publication a condition precedent to an action
for the infringement of any book. A provision was made in
this Act for an adjustment of the price of books by complaint
to the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chancellor and
others, if booksellers or printers set too high a price upon their
publications. Provision was also made for the delivery of
nine copies at the warehouse of the Stationers' Company for
the use of various libraries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">41 Geo. III.,
ch. 107.</div>

<p>The Act of Anne was amended in some particulars in 1801
by 41 Geo. III. c. 107. This Act gave the proprietor of the
copyright an action of damages against an offender as well as
providing forfeiture and penalties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">54 Geo. III.,
ch. 156.</div>

<p>The Act of Anne was again amended in 1814 by 54 Geo.
III. c. 156. This latter statute extended the period of copyright
to twenty-eight years certain, and the residue of the
author's life thereafter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Copyright
at Common
Law.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Injunctions
in Chancery.</div>

<p>After the passing of the statute of Anne those booksellers who
were in the habit of purchasing and publishing authors' manuscripts
were not satisfied with the limited protection accorded
to them by that Act. They discovered, by the aid no doubt
of legal advice, that a further protection might be secured by
setting up a common law right of literary property which would
ensure not merely a paltry term of twenty-eight years, but a
perpetual monopoly. The result of this discovery led to half a
century of litigation between the authors' booksellers and those
other smaller booksellers who contended that they might without
licence print those books in which the statutory copyright
had expired. At first the authors' men were successful, and
from 1735 there is a series of cases in Chancery in which a
common law right in published books was undoubtedly recognised
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
and a preliminary injunction granted, notwithstanding
that the period of protection given by 8 Anne, c. 19, had
expired.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Tonson</i> v.
<i>Collins</i>.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A collusive
action.</div>

<p>These injunctions appear to have been acquiesced in, and
the cases did not proceed to hearing. In 1760, in the case of
<i>Tonson</i> v. <i>Collins</i>,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the great question of common law right was
argued at law before Lord Mansfield, C. J. The action was in
respect of the <i>Spectator</i>, the statutory copyright in which had
expired. It was twice argued before Lord Mansfield, who
then ordered that it should stand over for further argument
before all the twelve judges. No judgment was ever given in
the case. Before it could be argued before the whole Court,
information reached the judges that the action was collusive,
brought for the purpose of obtaining a precedent to support
the contention of the authors' men. The Court refused to
proceed further with the cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Osborne</i> v.
<i>Donaldson</i>.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Millar</i> v.
<i>Taylor</i>.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Donaldson</i>
v. <i>Beckett</i>.</div>

<p>It was not long, however, until the question was again
raised. In 1765 Messrs. Osborne &amp; Millar, assignees of the
copyright in Thomson's "Seasons," filed their Bills in
Chancery against Donaldson, an Edinburgh bookseller, who
had, without their authority, reprinted the book after the
statutory copyright had expired.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> A preliminary injunction was
obtained, but subsequently dissolved. Lord Chancellor Northington
said it was a point of so much difficulty and consequence
that he should not determine it at the hearing, but
should send it to law for the opinion of the judges. The question
therefore again came to law, and, in <i>Millar</i> v. <i>Taylor</i>,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> was
argued at great length before Lord Mansfield and Justices
Aston, Willis and Yates. The authors' men were victorious.
The Court decided (Yates, J., dissenting) that there was copyright
at common law, and that the period of protection thereunder
was not cut down by the statute of Anne. This great
victory, however, afforded but a short-lived triumph to literary
men. In 1774, in <i>Donaldson</i> v. <i>Beckett</i>,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the matter came before
the House of Lords on appeal from an order in Chancery, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
the result that the decision in <i>Millar</i> v. <i>Taylor</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was overruled.
In this case all the judges were consulted. Eleven consulted
judges gave their opinion. The questions put to the judges,
and the answers given by them, are as follows:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinions of
the judges.</div>

<p>1. Whether at common law an author of any book or literary
composition had the sole right of first printing and publishing
the same for sale, and might bring an action against any person
who printed, published, and sold the same without his consent?</p>

<table class="vote" summary="Vote tally.">

    <td>Two answered</td>
    <td class="i10"></td>
    <td>That an action would only lie if the MS.<br />
were taken by fraud or violence.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>2. If the author had such right originally did the law take
it away upon his printing or publishing such book or literary
composition, and might any person afterward reprint and sell
for his own benefit such book or literary composition against
the will of the author?</p>

<table class="vote" summary="Vote tally.">

    <td>Seven answered</td>
    <td>No.</td>

    <td>Four answered</td>
    <td>Yes.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>3. If such action would have lain at common law, is it
taken away by the statute of 8th Anne? And is an author by
the said statute precluded from every remedy except on the
foundation of the said statute and on the terms and conditions
prescribed thereby?</p>

    <td>Six answered</td>
    <td>Yes.</td>

<p>4. Whether the author of any literary composition and
his assigns had the sole right of printing and publishing the
same in perpetuity by the common law?</p>

  <tr>
    <td>Seven answered</td>
    <td>Yes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Four answered</td>

<p>5. Whether this right is in any way impeached or taken
away by the statute of 8th Anne?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decision of
the House
of Lords.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Defeat
of the
Authors'
booksellers.</div>

<p>The House of Lords on a division, which included several
lay members of the House, decided by 22 to 11 against the
contention that the common law right survived the statute of
Anne and was unrestricted by it. So the authors and their
champions the booksellers were finally defeated, and had to
remain satisfied with the term of protection afforded to them
by statute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relief for
the Universities.</div>

<p>The Universities obtained from Parliament statutory relief
against the decision in <i>Donaldson</i> v. <i>Beckett</i>. In 1775, the Act
of 15 Geo. III. c. 53 was passed giving them a perpetual copyright
in all books which might be bequeathed to them. This
right they still retain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5 &amp; 6 Vict.
c. 45.</div>

<p>In 1842 the present literary Copyright Act was passed and
the statute of Anne and the two amending statutes of Geo. III.
repealed. The principal reform is the extension of the term
of protection to a period of forty-two years certain, or for the
author's life and seven years if that should prove longer.
Perhaps the other most important change (it cannot decently
be called a reform) is the reduction of registration at Stationers'
Hall to a mere useless and troublesome technicality. Instead
of being as formerly a condition precedent to protection, and
therefore a useful index from which one could ascertain whether
a book was copyright or not, it is now made merely a condition
precedent to action, and registration can be effected the same
day as that on which a writ is issued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Engravings.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the engravers as well as the authors had been
working for the proper protection of their art. In 1734 they
first obtained a statute which, together with the amending
statutes passed in 1766, 1776, and 1836 respectively, still
contains the law of copyright in engravings, prints, etchings,
and similar productions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sculpture.</div>

<p>In 1798 the sculptors obtained an Act. This was repealed
by another Act obtained in 1813. This latter Act still contains
the whole law as to copyright in sculpture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dramatic
Work.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Musical
Work.</div>

<p>In 1833 authors of dramatic work obtained from Parliament
an exclusive right to perform their plays whether published
or unpublished. By the Literary Copyright Act, 1842,
the provisions of that Act are made applicable to performing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
rights in dramatic work, and performing rights are still regulated
by both these Acts, which together contain the law on this
subject. The Literary Copyright Act, 1842, also applied the
provisions of both these Acts to performing rights in musical
compositions hitherto unprotected in this respect. As regards
musical composition, the law is amended by two subsequent
Acts which must be read with the two older Acts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lectures.</div>

<p>In 1835 an Act was passed for the protection of copyright
in lectures. This Act, although still in force, has become a
dead letter since the requisite notice to two Justices of the
Peace is troublesome, and lectures receive full protection from
copying by common law and under the Literary Copyright Act,
1842. The Lectures Act never purported to give anything
in the nature of a performing or lecturing right, but merely a
protection from unauthorised reproduction in print.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Paintings,
Drawings,
and Photographs.</div>

<p>The artists were the last to obtain protection for their work.
It was not until 1862 that an Act was passed giving statutory
protection to paintings, drawings, and photographs. This Act
contains the present law on the "Fine Arts."</p>

<div class="sidenote">International
Acts.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Berne
Convention.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Paris
Convention.</div>

<p>From 1844 onwards there is a series of Acts known as the
International Copyright Acts which extend the protection of the
copyright law to works published in certain foreign countries.
The last and principal international copyright Act is the International
Copyright Act, 1886. That Act was passed in view of the
Berne Convention of 1887 which was then in contemplation.
The Berne Convention is an international copyright agreement
whereby those states which are signatory to it agree that, subject
to its terms, a work first published in any one of those
states shall have copyright in all the others. The Berne Convention
is now amended by the Paris Convention, 1898, and
read together they form the present international agreement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Colonial
Acts.</div>

<p>There are several statutes dealing with the colonies dating
from 1847.

</div></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section I.&mdash;What is an Original Book.</span></h3>

<p><b>Definition of a Book.</b>&mdash;"Book" is defined by 5 &amp; 6 Vict.
c. 45, sec. 2, "to mean and include every volume, part or
division of a volume, pamphlet, sheet of letterpress, sheet of
music, map, chart, or plan separately published."</p>

<p>As an exhaustive definition this is of little value. It only
indicates what the outward visible form of the "book" must
be, and gives no indication of the nature or quality of the
literary matter which it must contain. Even as a guide to the
form it is defective, since it is only a definition by example and
not exhaustively descriptive. In the absence of an accurate
statutory definition of a "book," the Courts have given a very
wide interpretation to the term, and both as to the form and the
matter have strained the ordinary dictionary meaning of the word
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
to the uttermost. In the light of the decided cases a "book"
might be defined as <i>original literary matter in such tangible form as
readily conveys ideas or information to the mind of a reader</i>.</p>

<p><b>Essential Elements of a Book.</b>&mdash;There are three essential
elements which must be found in every book, viz.:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0"><span class="rgt">I.</span> A certain physical form.</span>
    <span class="i0"><span class="rgt">II.</span> Literary matter.</span>
    <span class="i0"><span class="rgt">III.</span> Originality.</span>
</div></div>

<p>I. <i>Physical Form.</i>&mdash;The form of the book need not necessarily
constitute what in common parlance is known as a book or
volume. Thus a single sheet of music<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> or a printed leaflet
such as an application form<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> are both books within the meaning
of the Copyright Acts.</p>

<p>In one case<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> it was held that a newspaper was not a book,
but that decision was not followed,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and there can now be no
doubt that a newspaper comes within the definition of a book
as a sheet of letterpress.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The form must be adapted for conveniently conveying to
the mind of a reader the intellectual matter which the book
contains. It will not be sufficient that it can possibly be used
for conveying intellectual matter to the mind, it must be conveniently
adapted for that purpose. Thus music in the form
of a perforated scroll for use in an æolian or pianola is not a
"book,"<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> for although it can be deciphered and read by the
eye no one in his senses would use it instead of an ordinary
sheet of music. On the other hand literary matter may nevertheless
be in "book" form although it requires a special
training to decipher it. For instance a story written in shorthand
characters is in book form,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and no doubt also a story
impressed in raised characters for the blind.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The substance on which the literary matter is depicted and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
the manner of depicting it are probably immaterial; but presumably
a "book" must be at least <i>ejusdem generis</i> as an ordinary
printed volume or leaflet. It must be "something in the nature
of a book."<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Thus although copies in ordinary manuscript<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
or even engraved on thin slips of ivory would be in "book" form,
an epitaph on a tombstone probably would not.</p>

<p>The meaning of the words "separately published" in
section 2 is by no means clear. They do not mean that the
matter in which copyright is claimed must be issued physically
separate from any non-copyright literary matter. In the
statute of Anne the words "separately published" are not used
in the definition of a book, but it was nevertheless argued that
a "book" must be entirely the original work of the author and
not bound up with other matter. In <i>Cary</i> v. <i>Longman</i> Lord
Kenyon rejected such an argument. In giving judgment he
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The courts of justice have long been labouring under an error if an
author have no copyright in any part of a work unless he have an exclusive
right to the whole book."<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Under the statute of Victoria parts of a book bound up
with non-copyright matter have frequently been protected;
notes to non-copyright works,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> illustrations to non-copyright
works,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> a small portion of a serial story,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> a small part of a time
table,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> have all been protected. Clearly therefore a person
may have copyright in a book although he has not copyright in
every part of it.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><i>In Johnson</i> v. <i>Newnes</i><a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Romer, J., takes the view that "separately"
published means clearly distinguishable. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now in my opinion if you find in a volume separate parts, and distinguished
or perfectly distinguishable from the other parts, and the
volume is published, each part that is separate and clearly distinguished in
the volume itself is separately published within the meaning of section 2."</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<p>If we accept this as correct we exclude the case of a
revised edition of an old work, the corrections and additions
to which forming the new work are not clearly distinguishable
from the old. I am inclined to think that the
real explanation and meaning of "separately published" is
that it does not apply to "volume, part, or division of a volume"
at all, but only to "sheet of letterpress, sheet of music, map,
chart, or plan" which are to be protected, even although they
are "separately published," <i>i. e.</i> not bound up into a volume.
It was no doubt inserted as declaratory of the case law under
the statute of Anne, which laid down that a single printed sheet
was a "book" within the meaning of the Act.</p>

<p>II. <i>Literary Matter.</i>&mdash;No literary merit or great labour is
required to be shown. Lord Halsbury, L. C., in <i>Walter</i> v. <i>Lane</i>,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
referring to the verbatim reports of Lord Rosebery's speeches
which were the subject-matter of that action, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Although I think in these compositions (<i>i. e.</i> the work of the stenographer)
there is literary merit and intellectual labour, yet the statute
seems to me to require neither&mdash;nor originality either in thought or
language ... the right in my view is given by the statute to the first
producer of a book, whether that book be wise or foolish, accurate or
inaccurate, of literary merit, or of no merit whatever."<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In many of the cases great stress was laid in argument
at the bar on the preamble of the Copyright Act, 5 &amp; 6
Vict. c. 45. The preamble runs as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Whereas it is expedient to amend the law relating to copyright, and
to afford greater encouragement to the production of literary works of
lasting benefit to the world...."</p></blockquote>

<p>From this it is argued that the Act intends to protect only
those works which are likely to prove a substantial addition to
the world's literature. Jessel, M. R., in his judgment in <i>Maple</i> v.
<i>Junior Army and Navy Stores</i>,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> points out the fallacy of this argument:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Act does not say that it is expedient to afford greater encouragement
to the production of literary works of lasting benefit to the world,
and to amend the law of copyright relating thereto, but that it is expedient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
to amend the law of copyright generally, merely adding the principal
reason for doing so. There is therefore nothing in the preamble to cut
down the enacting part, even if the enacting part had not been clear."<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Road-books,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> directories,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> tradesmen's catalogues,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> mercantile
statistics,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> telegraph codes,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> time tables,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> verbatim reports of
speeches<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> are all books within the meaning of the Act.</p>

<p>It is quite immaterial for what purpose the matter was
composed or published. Personal correspondence,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> advertisements,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
and a mining report<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> are all subjects of copyright if
published.</p>

<p>There must be some composition or arrangement of words,
figures, sentences, or paragraphs which by itself will convey
to the mind of the reader some intelligible proposition.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
There cannot be copyright in a single word,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> even although
it expresses a man's opinion: there is no composition or arrangement.
Neither can there be copyright in a pattern sleeve<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> or
the face of a barometer,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> because both are really instruments
to be used in conjunction with something else, and although
there may be words and sentences on them, by themselves they
convey no intelligible proposition to the reader. Probably a
drunken scrawl, absolutely unintelligible, would not be protected.
A jury having found that such a document was not a
literary composition, the Court of Appeal refused to interfere
with their verdict.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The illustrations in a book are protected as part of the
book,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and a number of drawings bound up together without
any letterpress would be protected as a book,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> compliance with
the provisions of the artistic Copyright Acts being in such a
case unnecessary; but a single drawing or engraving separately
issued can only be protected under the artistic Acts.</p>

<p>A map, whether bound in a volume or separately issued, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
a book within the meaning of the Literary Copyright Act, and
will be protected thereunder.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>III. <i>Originality</i> as an essential element of a book means that
the composition in the "book" must not have been copied from
some other literary composition in "book" form. Originality
does not necessarily imply an original composition on the part
of the author.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Copyright is given not necessarily to the first
composer, but to the first producer in "book" form of a literary
composition.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Thus a book would be an original book if the
literary matter contained therein were taken by the author
verbatim from the oral utterances of a public speaker,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> or probably
if copied from some ancient monument or mural writing.
It would not, however, be original if the author had merely
transcribed the literary matter from some public manuscripts,
even although difficult of access.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Again, originality does not
necessarily imply novelty. Another book exactly the same in
every respect, word for word, may have been previously published,
and yet a later book will be original if derived from
common sources, and not copied from the earlier book. Thus
two mathematicians may have independently made the same
calculations,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> two travellers may have made a chart of the same
island or district,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> or two reporters may have taken shorthand
reports of the same speech.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In each case there would
be independent copyright,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and the later book, even although
published ten years after the first, would be original.</p>

<p>Composition may consist in composition in the ordinary
sense of piecing together words, figures, sentences, and paragraphs,
in order to convey certain intellectual ideas, or it may
consist in the arrangement of material, as in the case of
directories, lists of statistics, &amp;c. Sometimes part may be
copied and part may be original, as in the case of new editions,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
translations,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> abridgments,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> selections from non-copyright
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
authors,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> precedents of conveyancing, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The new matter
only is the subject of copyright.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Road
Books.</div>

<p><b>Examples of what are Books.</b>&mdash;Road-books<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> were among
the first works in the protection of which by the Courts it was
recognised that copyright did not necessarily depend on the
evidence of any high mental qualities in the composition. In
1786 an injunction was granted to restrain the piracy of
"Paterson's Road-Book."<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Lord Chancellor Loughborough
in his judgment said that a book in order to acquire copyright
did not require to be an operation of the mind like the "Essay
on Human Understanding." There might be copyright even
although the subject-matter lay <i>in medio</i>, so that every man
with eyes could trace it, and the whole merit of the work
depended upon the accuracy of the observation. In 1776 the
Court of Session in Scotland protected a "Traveller's Pocket-Book,"
which contained nothing but a mere list of stages and
their distances.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The compiler of such a work may arrive at
the same, or nearly the same, result as some other compiler
working over the same country, but if each has made his own
compilation, "counting the milestones for himself,"<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> he will
have copyright and can prevent any one else from infringing
such copyright.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Directories.</div>

<p>Directories<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> soon followed road-books in their claim for
protection. Lord Chancellor Erskine in 1806 hesitated somewhat,
"thinking it dangerous to carry this doctrine of copyright
too far," but ultimately decided that an East India
calendar or directory<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> containing the names and appointments
on the Indian establishment, obtained with considerable labour
and expense from the repositories in India House, was the
subject of copyright. This decision was followed by Lord
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
Chancellor Eldon in 1809 in the case of "A Court Calendar."<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
In 1861 a street directory of Birmingham was protected,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and
in 1866 "Kelly's Post Office London Directory."<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> In this last-mentioned
case it was suggested in defence that the various
residents had given their names for public use, and that therefore
any one could copy them; this contention, however, was
rejected, and it was held that the information contained in a
directory was similar to that in a road-book or map; it was
open to all mankind, but that he who collected and described
it was entitled to prevent any one else from taking the results of
his labours. In <i>Morris</i> v. <i>Ashbee</i>,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> a trade directory, called
"The Business Directory of London," was protected. This
work contained the names and occupations of merchants and
traders carrying on business in or about London. Those
traders who paid the proprietor of the directory one shilling
annually were entitled to have their names printed in capital
letters, and a further payment entitled them to "extra lines"
descriptive of their vocations. The defendants took from this
work the names in capital letters and the "extra lines,"
and contended that they were entitled to do so; but it was held
that the payment by the several persons whose names were
inserted had not the effect of making the names and descriptions
when inserted common property, and that as the
plaintiff had incurred the labour and expense of getting the
necessary information and arranging it, he was entitled to
protection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Trade
Directory.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Sheet of
Advertisements.</div>

<p>In <i>Lamb</i> v. <i>Evans</i><a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> the defendants had copied extensively
from a trade directory. The directory consisted of a list of
tradesmen in various localities. In some cases their names and
addresses only were entered, and in others more elaborate
advertisements containing descriptions of articles in which
the advertiser dealt. The entries in the directory were classified
under headings, giving short descriptions of the particular
trades; each separate heading was arranged so that the proper
catch-words occurred first in alphabetical order, and each
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
heading was repeated in three other languages after the
English heading. The Court of Appeal held that although
the plaintiffs had no copyright in each individual entry, they
had copyright at least in the headings. They were the result
of literary labour both as regards the composition of the
headings themselves and their collocation and concatenation
in the book.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Their Lordships were also of opinion, although
they said it was unnecessary to decide the question, that there
was copyright in the mass of advertisements as collected and
arranged. Lindley, L. J., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I do not see myself the difficulty in the publishers having a copyright
in a sheet of advertisements. I do see a difficulty in his having a
copyright in one advertisement, because, as Mr. Justice Chitty pointed
out, that might prevent the advertiser from republishing his advertisements
in another paper, which is absurd. But to say that it follows from that
that the proprietor, say of the <i>Times</i>, has no copyright in a sheet of
advertisements so that he cannot restrain anybody from copying that
sheet appears to me a very different proposition."<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Catalogues.</div>

<p>Tradesmen's catalogues, consisting of lists descriptive or
otherwise of the articles in which they deal, have been often
attacked as being devoid of literary merit. In <i>Hotten</i> v. <i>Arthur</i><a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
the plaintiff's copyright in a descriptive catalogue of old books
which he had in stock was challenged. This catalogue was
not a mere list of the books by name, but contained short
notices of the contents and general nature of the various
volumes. Page Wood, V. C., found no difficulty in deciding
that such a catalogue was the subject of copyright, notwithstanding
that the catalogues were for the purpose of advertising
the plaintiff's stock-in-trade, and were not themselves
offered for sale. In <i>Cobbett</i> v. <i>Woodward</i><a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> the doctrine laid
down by Page Wood, V. C., received a check. In that case
the plaintiff had published a catalogue containing numerous
engravings and illustrations of designs and articles of furniture
which were sold by his firm. Lord Romilly, M. R., refused
to grant an injunction against a rival tradesman who, in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
similar publication, appropriated at least fifty of the plaintiff's
illustrations, and in his judgment he said:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Advertisements.</div>

<blockquote>

<p>"But at the last it always comes round to this, that there is no copyright
in an advertisement. If you copy the advertisement of another,
you do him no wrong, unless in doing so you lead the public to believe
that you sell the articles of the person whose advertisement you copy."<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The next case in which this question came before the Courts
was <i>Grace</i> v. <i>Newman</i>.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The book infringed was a volume
containing lithographic sketches of monumental designs, and
a little letterpress. The sole object of the book was to serve
as an advertisement in the plaintiff's business of "Cemetery
Stone and Marble Mason." Hall, V. C., granted an injunction,
evading <i>Cobbett</i> v. <i>Woodward</i><a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and following <i>Hotten</i> v.
<i>Arthur</i>.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> In 1882 <i>Cobbett</i> v. <i>Woodward</i><a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> was expressly overruled
in the Court of Appeal in the case of <i>Maple &amp; Co.</i> v.
<i>Junior Army and Navy Stores</i>.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The plaintiffs published an
illustrated catalogue consisting almost entirely of engravings
of furniture with short descriptions and prices. The catalogue
was prepared by selecting articles of furniture which were
drawn by artists in their employment and then engraved.
The Court of Appeal sustaining the opinion of Hall, V. C.,
in the Court below, held that the catalogue was the subject of
copyright as a book. Jessel, M. R., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The case which has done all the mischief is <i>Cobbett</i> v. <i>Woodward</i>.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>...
I think that is not law. I am not aware that the use to which
a proprietor puts his book makes any difference in his rights. His
copyright gives him the exclusive right of multiplying copies, and he may
use them as he pleases. I think, therefore, that <i>Cobbett</i> v. <i>Woodward</i><a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
will not bear legal examination."<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Alphabetical

<p>In <i>Collis</i> v. <i>Cater</i><a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> North, J., protected a catalogue of medicinal
articles which the plaintiff kept for sale. The articles were
arranged by their common names in alphabetical order under
various headings and sub-headings. The learned judge strongly
negatived the contention that a tradesman's catalogue would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
only be protected when, as in <i>Hotten</i> v. <i>Arthur</i>,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> some amount
of skill or literary merit was shown. He said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A distinction is made between copyright in a large catalogue by a
clever author which gives a great deal of information, and is interesting
to persons who read it, and a catalogue like the plaintiffs, which is
nothing whatever but a simple list of certain articles described by their
common names, which every one is entitled to use with respect to them
with the addition of the prices at which they are sold.... In one way or
another a man engaged in preparing a catalogue of this sort has incurred
labour in its preparation, or it may be expense and trouble in its preparation,
and has done it for the advantage of having his own catalogue....
I cannot see any distinction between this and the publication of a
directory. It seems to me to be exactly <i>in pari materia</i>."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Telegraph

<p>A list of telegraphic code words carefully selected so that,
in their transmission by the Morse system of dots and dashes,
they would not be liable to be mistaken or misspelt was
admitted to be a copyright work in <i>Ager</i> v. <i>P. &amp; O. Steam

<div class="sidenote">Shipping

<div class="sidenote">Mineral

<p>Lists of statistics compiled from various sources of information
are well recognised as original books. "The Clyde

statistics collected from the official records and documents in
the Custom houses, was protected in Scotland in 1846<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and
again in 1858.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The "Mineral Statistics of the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland" was protected in England in
1867.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> It consisted of an annual statement of returns in the
City of London coal market, showing the quantity of coal
imported into London from the various collieries, and was
compiled by the clerk and registrar of the coal market from the
day-books in the office. Page Wood, V. C., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A great deal of time and labour must have been spent in this compilation,
more, indeed, than in the case of a directory or guide, and there
can be no doubt that he is entitled to be protected in the fruits of his

<div class="sidenote">List of

<p>Compilations made from public documents and records are
protected in so far as there is selection or arrangement. A
mere verbatim copy of a public document would not be
protected.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> In <i>Trade Auxiliary Co.</i> v. <i>Middlesborough</i>,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> "Stubbs'

contained a list of bills of sale registered under the Bills of
Sale Act and of deeds of arrangement registered under the
Deeds of Arrangement Act. The particulars of each bill of
sale had been taken from the official records, not merely from
the indexes on the official register but from the instruments
themselves, for the inspection of each of which a charge of
1s. or 2s. 6d. is made. The same and other similar lists were
also protected in <i>Cate</i> v. <i>Devon</i>.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>In <i>Wyatt</i> v.<i> Barnard</i><a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Lord Chancellor Eldon refused protection
to a copy of specifications of patents taken from the
patent office. If this decision meant that a selection, arrangement,
or abridgment of the specifications in the patent office
would not be protected, it cannot be considered sound
law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">List of Foxhounds.</div>

<p>In <i>Cox</i> v. <i>Land and Water</i><a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Malins, V. C., although he refused
to grant an injunction on the grounds of its probable inefficacy,
expressed a strong opinion that a list of packs of
foxhounds, with the hunting days of each pack and their respective
masters and huntsmen, was the subject of property.
The information contained in the list was obtained by issuing
circulars requesting the masters of the hunt to fill up the
required information. The Vice-Chancellor in his judgment
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is clear that in this case the getting of the names of masters of
hunts, the number of hounds, the huntsmen and whips, and so forth is
information open to all those who seek to obtain it; but it is information
they must get at their own expense, as the result of their own labour, and
they are not to be entitled to the results of the labours undergone by
others."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Time
Tables.</div>

<p>One of the leading cases in this branch of copyright law is
<i>Leslie</i> v. <i>Young</i>,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> a Scotch appeal case. The pursuer's book consisted
of a monthly penny railway time table, published in Perth.
It was compiled from the various railway companies' time
tables. Some of these were taken verbatim and some were
abridged by the smaller stations being omitted, and to the whole
was added a list of convenient circular tours around Perth
compiled by the pursuer. The defender in compiling a rival
time table, copied many of these tables and all of the circular
tours from the pursuer's book, either literally or with colourable
differences only. As regards the time tables the House
of Lords sustained the judgment of the Inner House in refusing
an interdict. The mere publication, they said, in any particular
order of the time tables which are to be found in railway
guides and the publications of the different railway companies,
could not be claimed as a subject-matter of copyright. In
dealing with the abridged time tables Lord Herschell, L. C.,
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Looking at these tables as a whole, and having regard to the fact
that it is admitted that the defender's work is, as regards these tables, not
by any means in all respects a copy of the pursuer's work, that it was not
denied that there was a certain amount of original work done by them in
compiling these tables, and that these are the differences which have been
pointed out, I do not think that it can be said that as regards these tables
there has been an appropriation by the defender of the pursuer's work
such as to entitle the pursuer to complain and to obtain the interdict
which he claims. The real truth is that although it is not to be disputed
that there may be copyright in a compilation or abstract involving independent
labour, yet when you come to such a subject-matter as that with
which we are dealing, it ought to be clearly established that, looking at
these tables as a whole, there has been a substantial appropriation by the
one party of the independent labour of the other before any proceeding
on the ground of copyright can be justified."</p></blockquote>

<p>As regards the circular tours the House of Lords reversed
the judgment of the Court of Session and granted an interdict.
The Lord Chancellor said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It appears to me the only part of the work which can be said to
indicate any considerable amount of independent labour and be entitled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
to be regarded as an original work.... It seems to me that this was a
compilation containing an abridgment of information of a very useful
character, and such as was likely to be taken advantage of by those who
were travelling in the neighbourhood of Perth."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Tables of
Calculation.</div>

<p>Mathematical calculations are undoubtedly subjects of copyright.
In <i>Baily</i> v. <i>Taylor</i><a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Sir John Leach, M. R., evidently
assumed that they were, although in that case he refused an
injunction on the grounds that a very small part had been
copied, that what was copied could have been calculated again
in a few hours, and that there was unreasonable delay in
bringing the action. In <i>M'Neill</i> v. <i>Williams</i><a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> protection was
sought for "Comprehensive Tables for the Calculation of
Earthwork as connected with Railways," &amp;c. Knight Bruce,
V. C., refused an interim injunction, but he did not suggest that
the calculations were not the subject of copyright.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forms and
Precedents.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Conveyancing
Precedents.</div>

<p>Forms and Precedents and similar works are made and
published for the very purpose that they should be bought and
used in business or other transactions. To this extent copying
is of course no infringement, but they will be protected
from any copying other than that which is impliedly permitted
by their publication. In <i>Webb</i> v. <i>Rose</i><a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> precedents of
conveyancing were stolen from a barrister's chambers and
printed against his will. The Court had not the least hesitation
in restraining the defendant from printing and publishing
them. In the Scotch case of <i>Alexander</i> v. <i>Mackenzie</i><a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> the claim
of "Styles and Precedents of Conveyancing" to protection
under the Copyright Acts was recognised by the Inner House.
The forms in question were drawn up from general directions
contained in the "Heritable Securities and Infeftments Acts,"
and it was contended that, as all who followed these directions
must arrive at almost identically the same result, there could be
no copyright in a precedent so produced. The Court was
unanimously of opinion that although such work did not require
the exercise of original or creative genius, yet it implied
industry and knowledge, and was undoubtedly the subject of
copyright.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Application
Form.</div>

<p>In <i>Southern</i> v. <i>Bailes</i><a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> a form of application by intending
students to a "Lessons by Correspondence Department" was
protected by Chitty, J. The learned judge granted an injunction
against copying the plaintiff's form, but thought it would
be dangerous to extend the injunction in such a matter to
colourable imitations, as there was a great deal in the form any
one could have put together for himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Guide to

<p>It was very early recognised that the skill and labour of
selecting and arranging extracts from previously published
books was sufficient to entitle the compiler to copyright in the
new work thereby produced.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Copyright can thus be obtained
without the composition of a single sentence. There is composition,
but the composition is of new arrangement and not of
new matter. In <i>Rundell</i> v. <i>Murray</i><a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Lord Chancellor Eldon
expressed his opinion that a collection of cookery recipes
would have entitled the plaintiff who collected them to copyright,
even if she had merely embodied and arranged them in
a book. If, however, she had only collected them and handed
them over to the publishers, he did not think that would give
her copyright. In <i>Lewis</i> v. <i>Fullarton</i><a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> "The Topographical Dictionary
of England," which consisted partly of compilations and
selections from former works, was recognised as being the
subject of copyright. In <i>Lennie</i> v. <i>Pillans</i><a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> the Court of Session
in Scotland were of opinion that "The Child's A B C," consisting
in a great degree of extracts from and repetition of previous
publications by other authors, was entitled to protection on
account of the original arrangement, selection, abridgment, or
amplification of such borrowed materials. In <i>Jarrold</i> v. <i>Houlston</i><a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
Page Wood, V. C., granted an injunction against the piracy of
Dr. Brewer's "Guide to Science." The book was intended for
the instruction of tiros in science, and was composed largely
from previous works, aided by notes taken from time to time of
popular ideas concerning various scientific phenomena. The
Vice-Chancellor said:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That an author has a copyright in a work of this description is beyond
all doubt. If any one by pains and labour collects and reduces into the
form of a systematic course of instruction those questions which he may
find ordinary persons asking in reference to the common phenomena of
life, with answers to these questions and explanations of these phenomena,
whether such explanations and answers are furnished by his own recollection
of his former general reading or out of works consulted by him for
the express purpose, the reduction of questions so collected, with such
answers under certain heads and in a scientific form, is amply sufficient
to constitute an original work of which the copyright will be protected."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">French

<p>The same judge, in <i>Spiers</i> v. <i>Brown</i>,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> in considering an alleged
infringement of "Spiers' School Dictionary," said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In a large part of his work Dr. Spiers could have no copyright as to
words and expressions, though he might have it as to new words introduced
or new acceptations, or as to the order and arrangement by which
he improved the particular work he had in hand."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Selections
of Poetry.</div>

<p>In an Indian case Palgrave's "Golden Treasury of Songs
and Lyrics" was protected. It consisted in a selection and
arrangement of poems and fragments of poems from the non-copyright
works of many poets. The defendant took the
selected portions, rearranged them, and made a few additions.
His book was condemned as an infringement.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Abridgments.</div>

<p>Lawfully made abridgments are protected on account of
the judgment which the abridger must exercise in order to do
his work well.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Translations.</div>

<p>Lawfully made translations are also protected as if they
were original works.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The protection will only extend to the
work of the translator. A translator by translating a non-copyright
work acquires no exclusive right to translate.
Others may do the same from the original non-copyright
source.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adaptations.</div>

<p>An author is entitled to copyright by reason of lawful
adaptation of a book from one form to another; thus, if he
dramatizes a novel, or by material alteration and rearrangement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
produces a new version of an old play.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The adaptation

copyright.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New Editions
and
Notes.</div>

<p>New editions either of copyright or non-copyright works
are protected as original books, but only to the extent to
which they consist of original material in the way of notes to,
or substantial revision and alteration of the old text. Lord
Chancellor Hardwicke<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> granted an injunction against the piracy
of a new edition of Milton's "Paradise Lost" containing original
notes by Dr. Newton. In <i>Cary</i> v. <i>Longman</i><a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> new material added
to an old road-book was protected. In <i>Murray</i> v. <i>Bogue</i><a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> in the
case of a subsequent edition of a guide-book, Kindersley, V. C.,
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If a man prints a second edition, not being a mere reprint of the
first edition, but containing considerable and material alterations and
additions, <i>quoad</i> those, it is a new work."<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Cadell</i> v. <i>Anderson</i><a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> the Court of Session in Scotland
held that the pursuers had the sole right of printing and
reprinting "Blackstone's Commentaries;" and as regards those
editions in which there were corrections and continuations,
their term of copyright began to run afresh with respect to
such new material. In <i>Black</i> v. <i>Murray &amp; Son</i><a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> the notes
in Lockhart's edition of Scott's "Border Minstrelsy" were
protected, the copyright in the original edition of the "Border
Minstrelsy" having expired. Lord President Inglis, in the
course of a long and elaborate judgment, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Questions of great nicety and difficulty may arise as to how far a
new edition of a work is a proper subject of copyright at all; but that
must always depend upon circumstances. A new edition of a book
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
may be a mere reprint of an old edition, and plainly that would not
entitle the author to a new term of copyright running from the date of
the new edition. On the other hand, the new edition of a book may
be so enlarged and improved as to constitute in reality a new work,
and that just as clearly will entitle the author to a copyright running
from the date of the new edition.... That there may be copyright
in the notes, even when the book is not under the protection of copyright,
is quite a fixed principle in the law, and most desirably so. There
is no doubt that the compilation of good notes to a standard work is
a task worthy of the highest literary talents and reputation.... Of the
200 notes the defender's counsel tells us that 15 only consist of original
matter, while the remaining 185 are quotations from other books and
authors. Now this seemed to be considered to be a sort of disparagement
of the value of the notes, in which I cannot at all agree....
The quotations are, in many places, most apposite, and highly illustrative
of the text, and exceedingly interesting to the reader, and certainly
the selection and application of such quotations from other books may
exercise as high literary faculties as the composition of original matter."</p></blockquote>

<p>If a new edition is a mere reprint of what has been published
in "book" form before, it is obvious that no new or
independent copyright can be claimed in it.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> So also if
there are only slight corrections, verbal alterations, and the
like. Lord Mackenzie, in the Scotch case of <i>Hedderwick</i> v.
<i>Griffin</i>,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I doubt very much if there can be right of literary property in the
exclusion from an edition of the works of any author of articles not truly
written or published by that author, or in the correction of accidental
errors, or in the mere order and titles of articles which seem to be all,
or nearly all, that can be claimed by the pursuers in this case."<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The publication of an old work with an index not previously
published would undoubtedly be copyright as to the
index.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>In <i>Black</i> v. <i>Murray</i><a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Lord Deas was of opinion that the
alteration of a single word in a poem was sufficient to give a
new edition an independent copyright, inasmuch as the
alteration was very important and entirely altered the meaning
of the line in which it was used. The other judges, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
did not altogether concur in Lord Deas' opinion; and it
would seem that his lordship stretched the law as to new
editions too far.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reports.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Law Reports.</div>

<p>The question whether a verbatim report of oral proceedings
is a "book" within the meaning of the Copyright Acts
was long a moot question. That there might be copyright
in law reports and similar matter, in so far as they consisted
of a summary of the proceedings in the author's own language,
was early recognised. In <i>Butterworth</i> v. <i>Robinson</i><a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> the "Term
Reports"; in <i>Sweet</i> v. <i>Shaw</i>,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Meeson and Welsby's reports, and
others; and in <i>Sweet</i> v. <i>Maughan</i><a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> the reports in the "Jurist"
were protected; but it does not appear in the reports of these
cases whether any copyright was claimed in the verbatim
reports of the judgment of the Court. In <i>Saunders</i> v. <i>Smith</i><a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
Lord Cottenham, L. C., refused an injunction against "Smith's
Leading Cases" on equitable grounds, but said he would not
decide the legal question as to whether that publication infringed
the copyright in the "Term Reports" and others.
In <i>Sweet</i> v. <i>Benning</i><a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> the defendants published a "Monthly
Digest" into which were copied numerous head notes of cases
taken bodily from the "Jurist." The Court held that these
head notes were copyright, and that the defendant's work was
an infringement.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The head note or the side or marginal note of a report is a thing
upon which much skill and exercise of thought are required to express in
clear and concise language the principle of law to be deduced from the
decision to which it is prefixed, or the facts and circumstances which
bring the case in hand within some principle or rule of law or of
practice."<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Verbatim
Reports.</div>

<p>So far, therefore, as appears from the reports of these cases
our Courts had only recognised copyright in the matter of
reports to the extent to which that matter was the composition
of the author, only, in short, when it was a description in his
own language of what had taken place. The American Courts
had held<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> that there was no copyright in the verbatim report
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
of a judgment of the Court, but their decisions were based to a
large extent on the ground of public policy. The judgments of
the Court, they said, were published to the whole of the people
of the United States, and no individual could acquire a
monopoly with respect to them. <i>Walter</i> v. <i>Lane</i><a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> has to a large
extent cleared up the doubtful state of our law as regards
reports, but it cannot be said that it has done so entirely.
<i>Walter</i> v. <i>Lane</i><a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> decides that a reporter can have copyright in a
verbatim report of the oral utterances of another from whom
he derives no title. In that case certain reporters of the <i>Times</i>
were present at various meetings at which Lord Rosebery
made speeches. These speeches were taken down in shorthand
and appeared in the <i>Times</i> the following morning, reproducing
as nearly as possible verbatim the words which Lord
Rosebery had spoken. Lane, a publisher, subsequently published
a book entitled "Appreciations and Addresses: Lord
Rosebery," and purporting to be a collection of some of Lord
Rosebery's speeches. Five of the speeches in this book were taken
from the reports in the <i>Times</i>, as was admitted by the defendant,
substantially verbatim. The House of Lords reversing the
judgment of the Court of Appeal and restoring the judgment of
North, J., held that the reports in the <i>Times</i> were copyright,
and that the reporters' assignees, the proprietors of the <i>Times</i>,
were the owners of the copyright. Lord Chancellor Halsbury
in his judgment said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My Lords, I should very much regret it if I were compelled to come
to the conclusion that the state of the law permitted one man to make
profit and to appropriate to himself the labour, skill, and capital of another.
And it is not denied that in this case the defendant seeks to appropriate
to himself what has been produced by the skill, labour, and capital of
others. In the view I take of this case I think the law is strong enough
to restrain what to my mind would be a grievous injustice.... The
speeches and the sheets of letterpress in which they were contained were
books first published in this country; and I confess, upon looking at the
definition and the right conferred, I am wholly unable to discern why
they are not protected by the statute from being pirated by unauthorised
persons. The sole ground, as I understand the judgment of the Court
of Appeal, is that in their judgment the producer of a written speech,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
unless he is the original speaker, cannot be an 'author' within the
meaning of the Act. My Lords, it seems to me that this argument is
based upon too narrow and misleading a use of the word 'author.'...
The producer of this written composition is, to my mind, the person who
is the author of the book within the meaning of the statute.... I do
not find the word 'original' in the statute, or any word which imparts it
as a condition precedent, or makes originality of thought or idea necessary
to the right."<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We must be careful not to carry the doctrine of <i>Walter</i> v.
<i>Lane</i><a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> further than the actual decision warrants. It should be
noticed, for instance, that the essence of the case is that the
reporter was entitled to copyright, because it was he who
first reduced to "book" form the literary composition contained
in Lord Rosebery's speeches. If, therefore, Lord Rosebery had,
before delivering his speeches, done as some statesmen and many
clergymen do, <i>i. e.</i>, reduced them to writing, the reporter would
probably not have had copyright, since his report would then have
been a mere copy of the speaker's original manuscript, a very
different thing from being the first manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Again, it must
be noticed that Lord Rosebery claimed no proprietary right in
his speeches. It was admitted by counsel that he had freely
abandoned his words to the world so that any one might make
of them what use he pleased. Lord Rosebery might have
secured a right in his own speeches if he had cared to do so.
He might have delivered them to a limited audience<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> under an
implied contract that those who heard his speeches should
make no other use of them except by listening to them and
benefiting by the entertainment and general information conveyed.
Possibly he might also have secured a statutory copyright
in them as lectures by giving notice in writing two days before
delivering the same to two justices living within four miles of
the place of delivery.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> If in either of these ways Lord Rosebery
had secured a proprietary right for himself it is doubtful
whether a reporter unauthorised by him could have acquired
copyright in his report. The report would have been an
infringement of Lord Rosebery's rights, but the reporter might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
nevertheless be held to have a copyright against the rest of
the world. It should also be noticed in connexion with this
case that it was expressly stated by the judges in the House of
Lords that any number of reporters could make a report of
the same speech, and each would have a separate copyright.
In <i>Walter</i> v. <i>Lane</i><a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> the defendant admitted that he took his
book from the <i>Times'</i> report. It is obvious, however, that if a
speech were reported in, say, six newspapers, any one could
reprint it, and by careful correction of the parts in which the
reports varied baffle any one of the newspaper proprietors in
an attempt to prove that the speech was taken from his newspaper.
Another question with regard to verbatim reports,
which is not necessarily covered by <i>Walter</i> v. <i>Lane</i>,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> is in
reference to verbatim reports of judgments in the Courts.
Will the American doctrine be adopted that it is against public
policy that there should be any monopoly in them?<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The law of copyright does not protect anything in the
nature of a mechanical device, except in so far as apart from
any mechanical application it conveys ideas or information
to the person reading it. In <i>Page</i> v. <i>Wisden</i><a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> it was claimed by
the plaintiff that he had literary copyright in a cricket-scoring
card, the only novelty in which was a line along which could be
indicated "Runs at the fall of each wicket." Malins, V. C., held
that such a thing was not a book within the Act, and characterised
it as absurd to contend that a particular mode of ruling
a book constituted an object for a copyright.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Shadow

<p>In <i>Cable</i> v. <i>Mark</i>,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Bacon, V. C., refused to protect under the
Literary Act "The Christograph&mdash;the Christian's Puzzle: suitable
for all sects and denominations." This consisted of an
envelope on which the above title was inscribed. Inside the
envelope was a card perforated in such a way that when held
up in a strong light it threw upon the wall a shadow which was
supposed to represent the picture "Ecce Homo." The Vice-Chancellor
in his judgment described it as a mere child's trick
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
and nothing else. The face of a barometer was held by Chitty, J.,
in <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Comitti</i><a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> not to be a book. It consisted of a circular
card on which were printed various words such as "set fair,"
"high winds," &amp;c., and on which the hands of the barometer
moved. The learned judge said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Separated from the instrument it was not intended to have and
has no use or meaning whatever. Regarded as a card apart from
the instrument it not only foretells nothing, but tells nothing. By
reading the printed matter on the card alone, no intelligible proposition
is arrived at."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Sleeve
Chart.</div>

<p>Protection was claimed in <i>Hollinrake</i> v. <i>Truswell</i><a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> for a cardboard
pattern sleeve called the "Cosmopolitan Sleeve Chart."
It consisted of a piece of cardboard cut to suitable shape and
size and marked with figures and directions, such as "measure
round the thick part of the arm," and it was intended to be
used for the purpose of measuring and cutting out sleeves.
The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment of Wright, J., and
dismissed the action. Lord Herschell said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The object of the Copyright Act was to prevent any one publishing
a copy of the particular form of expression in which an author conveyed
ideas or information to the world. These may be retained by any one,
although the book, map, or chart which embodied them has passed out of
his possession. If he were to commit to memory the contents of the book
or the information disclosed by the map or chart, he would be as much in
possession of the author's ideas or information as if the book, map, or
chart were physically in his hands. But this is not the case with the
words or figures upon the sleeve chart. They are intended to be used,
and can only be used in connection with that upon which they are inscribed....
I think it clear, therefore, that what the plaintiff has sought
to protect under the Act for the protection of literary productions is not a
literary production, but an apparatus for the use of which certain words
and figures must necessarily be inscribed upon it."<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Boosey</i> v. <i>Whight</i><a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> it was held that a sheet of music was
not infringed by a perforated scroll for use in a mechanical instrument; and further, that the directions in the printed
music, <i>e. g.</i> <i>pp.</i>, <i>crescendo</i>, were not the subject of copyright
apart from the printed sheet, and therefore might be taken and
used in conjunction with the perforated scroll. It seems to
follow that neither the perforated scroll nor the directions thereon
would constitute a "book" within the meaning of the Act.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sporting

<p>The Court of Appeal held<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> that there could be no copyright

that there might be copyright in the list of selections for the
week, and that it would be an infringement to take it bodily.
Lindley, L. J., in giving judgment, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Unless you find the one horse selection and that block which is headed
by the title 'One Horse Selections' in the shape in which the plaintiff
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>

at all. Perhaps the whole of that might be called literary composition;
but there is no literary composition in the word 'Priestholm.'"<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Illustrations.</div>

<div class="sidenote">To Non-copyright
Letterpress.</div>

<p>Engravings, prints, designs, or other reproductions of
artistic matter will be protected under the law of literary
copyright either when published in the form of a volume or
when published in connexion and together with letterpress.
By this means compliance with the stringent requirements of
the Acts relating to artistic copyright is avoided. The first
case where an illustration was held to be part of a book, and
therefore protected under 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45, was <i>Bogue</i> v.
<i>Houlston</i>.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>. The plaintiff published some old non-copyright
tales, including "Reynard the Fox," and illustrated them with
original drawings of animals. These woodcuts were pirated by
the defendants, and used as illustrations in their serial publication,
"The Story-Book for Young People, by Aunt Mary."
The plaintiff did not claim copyright in any letterpress.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> The
defendants maintained that the woodcuts not having been
published so as to comply with the provisions of the Engravings
Acts, could not be protected from piracy. It was held,
however, that they were part of a book. Parker, V. C., in
giving judgment, quoted the definition of a book from the
Act 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45, and continued:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This definition does not extend to prints or designs separately published,
but only to the prints and designs forming part of a book, and the
book is not less a book because it contains prints or designs or other illustrations
of the letterpress. This Act vested in the proprietor of such book
duly registered the right to sue in respect of any invasion or infringement
of the copyright of his book. It appears to me that a book must include
every part of the book; it must include every print, design, or engraving
which forms part of the book as well as the letterpress therein which is
another part of it."<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Maple &amp; Co</i>. v. <i>Junior Army and Navy Stores</i>,<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> the engravings
in an illustrated catalogue, containing almost no letterpress,
were protected under 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45. "There may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
be such things," said Jessel, M. R., "as picture-books for those
who cannot read letterpress."<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> In <i>Hildesheimer &amp; Faulkner</i> v.
<i>Dunn &amp; Co.</i>,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> protection was claimed for a Christmas card cut
out and painted in the form of a lady's hand. It opened out
book-wise, and inside were delineated the lines of life according
to the rules of palmistry, and on one side there was an
original verse. This work was registered both under 5 &amp; 6
Vict. c. 45 as a book and 25 &amp; 26 Vict. c. 68 as a painting.
Kekewich, J., in granting an injunction against a piracy, said
he would not decide whether the work was a picture or a book,
but as it was well registered under both Acts, an action lay.
In <i>Comyns</i> v. <i>Hyde</i>,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> a coloured plate representing an Orpington
cock was issued with the weekly number of a serial publication
called <i>The Feathered World</i>. The plate was not in any
way physically connected with the rest of the publication, but
it was illustrative of an article in the journal, and a copy was
given to every purchaser. Stirling, J., held that it must be
protected as part of the book. If a plate or picture has been
previously published in separate form, without complying with
the provisions of the Engravings Acts, it will not subsequently
receive protection by reason of its incorporation into a volume.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
In <i>Strong</i> v. <i>Worskett</i><a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> a magazine was before publication
advertised by means of illustrated posters. The same illustration
as appeared on the posters was afterwards reproduced
in the magazine. It was held that it could not be protected
as part of the magazine. The result of these decisions appears
to be that an artistic work will be protected under the Literary
Copyright Act, 1842, if it is bound up with other artistic works
in the form of a volume, or if it is published in connexion
with letterpress. The picture on a Christmas card on which
there are also verses, would, it is submitted, be protected
as a book, and, it would seem, whether or not the verses were
copyright, and whether or not (but this is more doubtful) the
picture was in any way illustrative of the verses. It is also
submitted that an engraving published in a magazine without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
any relation to the letterpress, except that of physical connexion,
would be protected as part of the book; but an engraving
or print which had neither any relation to the letterpress nor
physical connexion would probably not be protected even
although issued gratis with every copy of the magazine.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that anonymous works are entitled
to copyright. The publication of a work without the author's
name is not to be construed as an abandonment of the literary
property.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Maps.</div>

<p>Maps, charts, and plans are expressly included in the
definition of a "book." If incorporated in a volume they will
be protected with the rest of the volume under its general
title; if published separately they will be protected as "books"
by themselves. The meaning of "maps," &amp;c., will be literally
construed; but it must be something which in itself conveys
information to the person studying it. Davey, L. J., in speaking
of maps, said<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]:</a>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I agree ... that a 'map' is not confined to what is popularly known
as a map&mdash;viz. a geographical map; and that a 'chart' is not confined to
what is popularly called a chart&mdash;viz. a map of a portion of the seas
showing the rocks, soundings, and such-like information for the use of
navigators.... There may, no doubt, be an anatomical and physiological
plan showing the structure and distribution of the muscles and bones of
the human arm, or any other part of the human frame, which would be
protected by the Copyright Act."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Music.</div>

<p>The exclusive right of making copies of original music is
expressly protected by the Act of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45 under the
definition of a book. Under the statute of Anne it was protected
by case law, "book" being held to include a volume
or sheet of music.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section II.&mdash;Publication.</span></h3>

<p>Publication divests the author or proprietor of an unpublished
work of his common law rights therein. After
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
publication his right to protection depends solely upon the
statute. Publication must be looked at from two points of view&mdash;divestitive,
<i>i. e.</i> as taking away the author's common law
right; and investitive, <i>i. e.</i> as clothing him with the statutory
right.</p>

<p><b>Divestitive Publication.</b>&mdash;If a literary work is communicated
to the public without restriction, the common law right of
the author terminates. This may be done orally or by written or
printed manuscript. Either kind of communication, however,
may be so limited as not to amount to a publication. A
drama or musical work is not published by being publicly
performed in a theatre or concert room,<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> since the communication
is limited to those who have paid their price for
admission, and they are admitted under an implied contract
that they will not make any use of what they hear except for
their own entertainment and instruction. The same applies to
lectures delivered at a University<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> or by a private lecturer.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> The
question as to when a public speaker or preacher publishes the
speech or sermon which he delivers is one of extreme difficulty,
and depends on the relation of the speaker to his audience.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
If a literary composition is orally communicated in a place to
which all have admission as of right, or to which all are admitted
without distinction, and where there are no circumstances
from which a contractual relationship between the speaker and
his audience can be inferred, the matter so communicated will
be abandoned to the public to make what use of it they please.
Similarly communication by means of manuscript or print may
be limited or unlimited. Private distribution of copies of a
book is not publication, because the essence of publication is
that the matter must be available to all comers and not only
to a class;<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> but the issue of a book to subscribers only would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
be publication if the subscription list was open to the public at
large, and even although the number of copies available was
very small. In one case<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> the words of a song were held to be
published by being printed on a music-hall programme and
distributed in the streets as an advertisement. Exhibition in a
public place without distribution of copies would undoubtedly
be divestitive publication. Divestitive publication must be
with the consent of the proprietor; an unlicensed publication
would merely be an infringement of his rights.</p>

<p><b>Investitive Publication.</b>&mdash;Publication vests the statutory
right of copyright, but a publication which divests the common
law right does not necessarily invest the statutory right. An
investitive publication is of necessity also a divestitive publication,
but not <i>vice versâ</i>. The principal distinction is that an
investitive publication must be a publication of a book, while a
divestitive publication is a publication of the literary composition
which is or may be contained in a book. Thus the
delivery of a lecture does not vest copyright, although under
certain circumstances it may divest the common law right.
The book itself must be given to the public, and not merely
the contents, in order to secure copyright. It has been suggested
that a book will not be published within the meaning of
the Copyright Act unless it is also printed. There is certainly
some colour for this suggestion. The Act 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45
gives protection to all books which are "published" without
any express restriction to printed books. It seems to be
assumed, however, throughout the Act that a book when published
must necessarily be in print. For instance, section 6
requires "That a printed copy ... shall be delivered at the
British Museum." In section 11 again, where provision is
made for registration, it is not contemplated that a book in
which there is copyright could be in manuscript, although the
section makes express provision for the registration of manuscript
dramatic and musical pieces, in respect of performing
right. There is no authority on this point. In <i>White</i> v. <i>Geroch</i><a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
it was said that publication of a musical piece in manuscript
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
vested the statutory copyright; but this was under the statute
of Anne, which seems expressly to contemplate publication in
manuscript which 5 &amp; 6 Vict. certainly does not. In <i>Boucicault</i>
v. <i>Chatterton</i><a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> James, L. J., says: "a book is published by
being printed and issued to the public;" but this was said
only in illustration of the point he was then making, viz.
that publication does not necessarily mean the same thing
in dealing with copyright as it does in dealing with performing
right. On the whole, although the point is extremely
doubtful, I am of opinion that printing is not required.
Suppose an illuminated hand-made book, fifty copies
put on the market, is that to be denied copyright? If it is, the
result seems to be that it is unprotected from piracy, since the
common law right terminates with unconditional publication.
Another point on publication has been raised but not decided,
viz.: Must there be a distribution of copies to the public, or
will it be sufficient if one or more copies are made accessible
to the public; for instance, by deposit of a copy at the British
Museum or in other public libraries. Sir James Stephen, in his
Digest appended to the "Report of the Copyright Commission,
1878," Art. 4, says: "publication ... means in reference to
books, publication for sale;" and James, L. J., as cited above,
suggests that there must be an "issuing to the public." On the
other hand, the disjunctive use of the terms "published" and
"offered for sale " in section 6 of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45 is rather in
favour of the view that there can be investitive publication
without "offering for sale." Analogy from other branches of
the law is unreliable; the exhibition of a picture in a public
gallery is publication of the picture,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> but that is the only way in
which a picture can be published. On the whole, I think that
if the public have free and unrestricted access to a book there
will be publication, even although they may not be able to
procure copies for themselves. Something might depend on
the rules of a library where the book was deposited.</p>

<p>There is a common practice among publishers to accept as
proof of first publication a receipt given on the sale of a single
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
copy of the book. No doubt this is <i>primâ facie</i> proof of publication,
but the sale of a single copy does not necessarily imply
publication, and it would be open to any one disputing the
date of the publication to say that the sale was collusive, and
that the book was not at that time, as it must be in order to
constitute publication, offered to the public. It would be sufficient
publication for the publisher to place copies, or even one
copy of the book, in his window for sale. The record in his
books should be sufficient evidence of the date if it is disputed.</p>

<p>In a case<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> under the statute of Anne it was held that publication
must be by or on behalf of the proprietor, or at least
with the view of conferring copyright upon him. The publication
in that case was made by an oral assignee to whom the
author had purported to convey the exclusive right of publication
in the United Kingdom. It was held that the assignee had
no copyright because there was no written assignment, and that
the author did not acquire copyright because the publication
was not on his behalf. The result seems to be that the copyright
was lost. If the principle is sound, which is extremely
doubtful, it might be applied to the case of first publication by
a licensee, unless it could be implied from the contract between
the licensor and licensee that the licensee was not acting
entirely on his own behalf, but also on behalf of his licensor
to secure copyright.</p>

<p><b>First Publication within the British Dominions.</b>&mdash;Under the
Act of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45, it was held essential that first publication
should be within the United Kingdom;<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> but since
the International Act of 1886<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> first publication anywhere
within the British dominions will equally secure copyright.
If a book is published simultaneously within and without the
dominions it is sufficient.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Publication a day later than publication
abroad would probably lose the copyright; but if on
the same day, even although an hour or two later, it would
be deemed simultaneous. If a serial story in a periodical is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
being published simultaneously, say here and in the United
States, some parts may have lost their copyright by too hasty
publication in America, but this would not deprive the whole
serial of copyright if the other parts were "first published"
within the British dominions.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The date on the title-page
of an American book has been held not to be conclusive
evidence of the time of publication in the United
States.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> It is quite immaterial where the manuscript is
written;<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> and probably equally immaterial where the book
is printed. It has been suggested, however, that under
5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45, printing within the United Kingdom was
necessary, and that now since the "International Copyright
Act, 1886," printing within the British dominions is a condition
precedent to protection. I do not think the suggestion
is of any weight. It is founded on two <i>obiter dicta</i>&mdash;one of
Lord St. Leonards in <i>Jefferys</i> v. <i>Boosey</i>,<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> and the other of
Bayley, J., in <i>Clementi</i> v. <i>Walker</i>.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>If a book is first published outside the British dominions
there will be no copyright<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> in it except under the International
Statutes.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Section 19 of 7 &amp; 8 Vict. has been held to
apply to publication in all foreign countries, and not only to
those with which an international convention is in existence;<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
and it has been further held to apply to the works of a
British subject as well as to those of a foreigner.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>If a dramatic or musical work is first performed abroad
before publication as a book, although that may destroy the
performing right within the British dominions, it probably
will not affect the author's right to acquire copyright by
first publication here in "book" form. It may be said
that "first published" in 7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. 12, sec. 19, has
been held to include "first performed."<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> That decision,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
however, dealt only with a question of performing right. In
<i>Boosey</i> v. <i>Davidson</i><a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> there was first performance abroad, and it
was held that copyright was obtained here by first publication;
but there was no argument on section 19.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section III.&mdash;Author's Nationality.</span></h3>

<p>It must still be considered doubtful whether or not the
author of a book must be a British subject, or at least
resident within the British dominions at the time of publication.
This point is the subject of a considerable body of
case law under the statute of Anne; but there has been no
definite and authoritative decision under the statute of Victoria.
The question was first seriously argued in the case of <i>D'Almaine</i>
v. <i>Boosey</i>,<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> when it was decided in the Court of Exchequer that
the work of a foreigner would be entitled to protection if
first published in England by an English assignee. The next
case was <i>Bentley</i> v. <i>Foster</i>,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> before Shadwell, V. C., who decided
that the foreigner himself could acquire a copyright by first publication
in this country. After that there is a series of confused
and conflicting cases,<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> terminating with the decision of <i>Jefferys</i>
v. <i>Boosey</i><a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> in the House of Lords. The plaintiff in that case
was the English assignee of the unpublished work of a non-resident
foreigner. The first publication was in England.
The judges were consulted, and of these six were in favour
of the plaintiff's right and four against it. The House of
Lords, however, were unanimous against the plaintiff's right.
They decided that the work of a non-resident foreigner could
not acquire copyright in this country.</p>

<p>Lord Cranworth, L. C., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The statute (8 Anne) must be construed as referring to British
authors only. <i>Primâ facie</i> the legislature of this country must be taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
to make laws for its own subjects exclusively, and where, as in the statute
now under consideration, an exclusive privilege is given to a particular
class at the expense of the rest of her Majesty's subjects, the object
of giving that privilege must be taken to have been a national object
and the privileged class to be confined to a portion of that community
for the general advantage of which the enactment is made. When
I say that the legislature must <i>primâ facie</i> be taken to legislate only for
its own subjects, I must be taken to include under the word 'subjects'
all persons who are within the Queen's dominions, and who thus owe to
her a temporary allegiance. I do not doubt but that a foreigner resident
here, and composing and publishing a book here, is an author within the
meaning of the statute: he is within its words and spirit. I go further:
I think that if a foreigner having composed but not having published a
work abroad were to come to this country, and the week or day after his
arrival were to print and publish it here, he would be within the protection
of the statute."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Jefferys</i> v. <i>Boosey</i><a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> then definitely decided that under the
statute of Anne a foreigner, unless at the time of publication
he was resident within the jurisdiction of the crown, could
not be an author within the meaning of the Act, and therefore
neither he nor his assigns before or after publication
could acquire copyright. It would seem to follow that the
construction of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45 would lead to a similar
decision. This, however, has been doubted in the House of
Lords in the case of <i>Routledge</i> v. <i>Low</i>.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> The actual decision
in that case went no further than holding that a foreign
author who was resident for a few days in Canada expressly
for the purpose of acquiring copyright while her book was
published in London was an author within the Act, a proposition
which had not been disputed in <i>Jefferys</i> v. <i>Boosey</i>.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
Their Lordships, however, discussed the wider issue whether
even temporary residence was necessary. Lord Cairns, L. C.,
and Lord Westbury were of opinion that it was not. Lord
Cairns, after pointing out that <i>Jefferys</i> v. <i>Boosey</i><a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> was a decision
under the Act of Anne, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was impossible not to see that the <i>ratio decidendi</i> in that case
proceeded mainly, if not exclusively, on the wording of the preamble of the
statute of Anne, and on a consideration of the general character and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
scope of the legislation of Great Britain at that period. The present
statute had repealed that Act, and professed to aim at affording greater
encouragement to the production of literary works of lasting benefit to the
world. And accepting this decision of the House as to the construction
of the statute of Anne, it is, I think, impossible not to see that the present
statute would be incompatible with a policy so narrow as that expressed
in the statute of Anne."<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Lords Cranworth and Chelmsford agreed that temporary
residence within the dominions was sufficient to give a foreigner
the right to acquire copyright as a British author, and therefore
concurred in the judgment of the House. They, however,
differed strongly from the view that a non-resident
foreigner could be an author within the Act. Lord Cranworth
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have no hesitation in concurring with my noble and learned friend
in thinking that the decree below was right. I find it difficult to concur
with him in the opinion that the present statute extends its protection to
all foreigners wherever they may be resident without saying that the case
of <i>Jefferys</i> v. <i>Boosey</i><a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> is not good law&mdash;a conclusion at which I should
be very unwilling to come as to any case decided in this House, more
especially as to one so elaborately considered as that of <i>Jefferys</i> v. <i>Boosey</i>.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
That case, as my noble friend has pointed out, was decided not on the
construction of the Act of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45, but on the statute of Queen
Anne; but I own I do not as at present advised see any difference
between the two statutes so far as relates to the subject of the residence
of foreign authors."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Routledge</i> v. <i>Low</i><a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> is followed as to its actual decision in
<i>Low</i> v. <i>Ward</i>;<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> but as to the rights of a non-resident foreign
author the law remains, as left by <i>Routledge</i> v. <i>Low</i>,<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> truly in a
most unsatisfactory state. It is difficult to escape from the
conclusion, however willingly one would, that there is really
no distinction between the application of the statute of Anne
and that of Victoria, and that, therefore, a case arising on this
point under the Act of Victoria is governed by <i>Jefferys</i> v. <i>Boosey</i>,<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
a decision which, if erroneous, was not so for want of
deliberate research and consideration. The general opinion,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
however, seems to be that Lords Cairns and Westbury were
right and Lords Cranworth and Chelmsford wrong. This view
is adopted by Stephen, J., in his digest.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Mr. Scrutton is of the
same opinion, and cites the Naturalisation Act and the proviso
that copyright is personal property.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Mr. Chamier does the
same.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> It is respectfully submitted that the provisions of the
Naturalisation Act and the indisputable fact that a foreigner
wherever resident can acquire a British copyright are entirely
beside the mark, and do not in the least help one to decide
whether the legislature is to be presumed to have applied the
Act of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. to the works of foreign authors. The decision
that the work of a non-resident foreign author will not be
protected is in no way contrary to the provision of the Naturalisation
Act that an alien friend may acquire and hold personal
property in the same way in all respects as a British subject.
The logical conclusion from that provision is that an alien
friend as well as a British subject may acquire British copyright
wherever it exists; but it does not necessarily follow that
British copyright exists in the work of a foreign author, and
that either an alien friend or a British subject can acquire it.
After the passing of the Chace Act (1891) in the United States,
the law officers of the Crown in England were consulted by the
American law officers, and they advised that an American author
could acquire copyright in his work by simultaneous publication
in this country and America, even although he was not at
any time resident within the British dominions. Consequently
on that advice the President of the United States proclaimed
Great Britain as one of the countries which gave by their law
reciprocal rights to American authors; and English authors are
thereby entitled to acquire copyright in the United States. It
would certainly be most unsatisfactory if the law of England were
now to be declared contrary to the advice then given by our law
officers, but it cannot be said that this should influence our
Courts if their decision on the point was called for.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section IV.&mdash;Immoral Works.</span></h3>

<p>Profane,<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> indecent,<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> seditious,<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> and libellous<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> books will not be
protected. Neither will those which are a fraud upon the public.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
For instance, a book published as translated from the German
of Sturm, which was entirely untrue and induced purchasers
to buy it, was refused protection.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> <i>Quære</i> whether a piratical
book would be protected in so far as it was original. Probably
it would.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> If a book is not wholly mischievous, but only in
part, it will probably be protected except as to that part;<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> and
if a book is subsequently published purged of its immoral
matter or fraudulent nature it would be protected.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> If an
action is brought in respect of a mischievous publication the
practice of the Court is to dismiss the action without costs.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
In one case<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Mathew, J., would not take cognisance of immorality
<i>mero motu</i>, and when it was not pleaded by the
defendant he gave the plaintiff his remedy. Notwithstanding
this, there can be no doubt that the Court may refuse to interfere
even when both parties are willing to waive the question of
immorality. The Court cannot be compelled to sit to take an
account between public malefactors.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section V.&mdash;Registration.</span></h3>

<p><b>Before Action.</b>&mdash;Before an owner of copyright sues for
infringement his book must be registered at Stationers' Hall.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
The omission to register does not affect the copyright in a
book, but it is a condition precedent to the right to sue in
respect of the infringement thereof.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> At one time it was thought
that registration was only a condition precedent to an action
for the particular remedies given by the statute, and that whether
registration was effected or not the common law right of action
for damages lay.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> This, however, is not law. Registration
is a condition precedent to any right of action for infringement
of copyright. If an action is brought without proper registration,
that action must fail; but a correct entry may then be
made and a fresh action commenced.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>No registration is necessary to maintain an action for the
infringement of performing rights in a book which is a dramatic
or musical work.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Registration need not be made before infringement: it may
be effected at any time before the writ is issued.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> In one case
it was held a good registration when entry was made on the
same day, but a few hours before the issue of the writ.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> In
<i>Hole</i> v. <i>Bradbury</i>,<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Fry, J., held that registration after infringement
did not entitle the plaintiff to delivery up of copies for
his own use under the 23rd section of the Act of 1842, but
that under its general jurisdiction the Court had power to
order delivery up for destruction. In <i>Isaacs</i> v. <i>Fiddemann</i>,<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
Jessel, M. R., thought that even although infringement was before
registration the plaintiff was entitled to have delivery up for
his own benefit, and that the 23rd section applied to such a
case. Which is the correct view it is difficult to say. The
argument of Fry, J., in support of his view is elaborate and
appears sound, whereas Jessel, M. R., seems to have gone more
on the ground of convenience.</p>

<p>Registration must be effected after the publication of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
book.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> In several cases an attempt has been made to secure a
monopoly in a title by registration before the book was published
or even written.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Such registration is entirely inoperative
to secure a monopoly in the title or the right to sue in respect
of the copyright in the book when published. Registration
does not give the plaintiff any right (except perhaps as to
delivery of copies) which he would not equally have had without
registration.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> All registration does is to perfect the right
and give a title to sue on it.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that it is the book which is to be
registered and not the copyright. It is common but erroneous
to talk of "registering copyright." The distinction was pointed
out in <i>Trade Auxiliary</i> v. <i>Middlesborough</i>.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> The three several
proprietors of three periodicals had employed and paid a contributor
under section 18 on the terms that the matter contributed
should belong to these three proprietors. The matter appeared
in each of the three newspapers and each registered his own
newspaper in his own name. It was argued that the registration
was bad, since they should have been registered as joint
proprietors, but the Court of Appeal held that the registration
was good, since each had registered his "book," and section 19
was literally complied with.</p>

<p>A newspaper is a sheet of letterpress within the Act and must
be registered.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> In one case<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> Malins, V. C., protected a newspaper
which was not registered, but that case has been
expressly overruled<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and is clearly unsound. No registration
is necessary other than that required by the Act of 1842. In
<i>Cate</i> v. <i>Devon</i><a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> it was contended that a newspaper would not
be protected unless it had been registered under the Newspaper
Libel Act, 1881. This contention was held erroneous, and
registration under the Act of 1842 was alone required. Similarly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
it is not a good defence to an action for infringement that
the publisher's name and address is not printed on the first
or last page of a book as required by 2 &amp; 3 Vict. c. 12.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p><b>The Requisite Entry.</b>&mdash;Registration is made in the Book of
Registry which the Act enacts<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> shall be kept at the Hall of the
Stationers' Company. The fee for registration is five shillings.
The Book of Registry must at all convenient times be open
to the inspection of any person on payment of one shilling for
every entry searched for or inspected. This, however, does
not entitle any one to make a copy of an entry; but any one
may demand a certified copy of an entry from the keeper of
the Registry on payment of five shillings.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the copyright must register in the Book
of Registry:<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0"><span class="rgt">i.</span> The title.</span>
    <span class="i0"><span class="rgt">ii.</span> The time of first publication.</span>
    <span class="i0"><span class="rgt">iii.</span> The name and place of abode of the publisher.</span>
    <span class="i0"><span class="rgt">iv.</span> The name and place of abode of the proprietor.</span>
</div></div>

<p>In the case of an encyclopædia, review, magazine, periodical
work, or other work published in a series of books or parts, the
publisher must register:<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0"><span class="rgt">i.</span> The title.</span>
    <span class="i0"><span class="rgt">ii.</span> The time of first publication of the first part.</span>
    <span class="i0"><span class="rgt">iii.</span> The name and place of abode of the proprietor.</span>
    <span class="i0"><span class="rgt">iv.</span> The name and place of abode of the publisher if different from the proprietor.</span>
</div></div>

<p><i>The Actual Title.</i>&mdash;This must be registered: a description of
the book will not be sufficient, even although accurate. Thus in
<i>Harris</i> v. <i>Smart</i><a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> the plaintiffs' book was intituled "Illustrated
Catalogue and Price List," and they registered it as "Illustrated
Book of Shop-fittings." The Court of Appeal, reversing the
decision of Mathew and Grantham, JJ., held that the objection
to the registration was fatal. When there is a clear and distinct
title, that title they held must be registered. It might be different
if a book had no title; perhaps such a book could not be registered
at all; but probably a description of the book, stating that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
it had no title, would be sufficient.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> In <i>Collingridge</i> v. <i>Emmott</i><a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
the plaintiff's newspaper was intituled "Warehousemen and
Drapers' Trade Journal and Review of the Textile Fabric Manufacturers";
but it was registered as "Warehousemen and Drapers'
Trade Journal: Failures and Arrangements." Kay, J., thought
that the discrepancy was fatal to the registration.</p>

<p>It has been questioned whether in the case of a volume, a
considerable part of which, being old matter, is not entitled to
copyright, and which is published under one comprehensive
title, there must not be some indication on the book itself or on
the register that the owner does not claim copyright in the whole
work. The point has never been definitely decided. It has
been held that one who adapts new words and music to an old
air and describes himself proprietor of the whole composition is
entitled to protection;<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> but the question raised in these cases
was whether the author was entitled to copyright at all unless he
could show that the whole was original. It should always be
remembered in questions of this kind that the purpose of
registration is not, as has frequently been suggested in argument,
to notify to an intending copyist what he may copy and what he
may not. In <i>Cate</i> v. <i>Devon</i><a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> the plaintiffs had published a
"Commercial Compendium," containing lists of bankruptcies
and bills of sale. They reprinted several copies of it under
another title, viz. "The London Association for the Protection
of Trade," and it was issued "privately and confidentially" to
that association. The defendants copied matter from the latter
issue and pleaded that it was unregistered, and therefore that
they were entitled to copy it. North, J., held that the act of the
defendants was an infringement of copyright in the "Commercial
Compendium," which was registered under that title. In his
judgment he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is not intended that there should always be complete registration
of the publication in which there is copyright in order that persons may
know what they may legitimately copy and what they cannot copy. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
Act itself contains provisions which make that clear. It is well known
that registration is only necessary as a condition precedent to suing, and
the almost universal practice on the part of large publishers notoriously is
that they do not register until just on the eve of taking some proceeding.
Then they take care to register their copyright and sue upon it. I think,
therefore, that the contention that the defendants have not been warned
by registration of the title under which the document appears is one which
cannot be entertained."<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Time of First Publication.</i>&mdash;This must be exactly entered
to the day of the month. In <i>Low</i> v. <i>Routledge</i><a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> an entry of
"23rd May 1864" was held to be bad when the actual publication
was on the 25th of May 1864.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Under the International
Copyright Act, 1844, an entry of the year only was held to be
fatal,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> and under the Copyright Act of 1842 it has been held in
two cases that an entry of the month only is bad.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> When a
subsequent edition of a book is published, in so far as it is a
reprint of the first edition, it will not be protected unless the first
edition and the date of the first publication thereof is entered on
the register;<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> in so far as it consists of new matter there must
be an entry bearing the date of the publication of the edition in
which such new matter was first published;<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> but the previous
editions and the date of their respective publications do not
require to be entered in order to protect the new matter,<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> and
subsequent editions do not require to be entered in order to
protect old matter.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Where a book has been revised and altered
as each new edition has come out, every edition should be
entered separately in the register, with the date of the publication
of such edition. When a story, or article, or serial story, or a
series of articles is published in a magazine or other periodical,
the proprietor of the magazine need only register the first number
of the magazine and the date of the publication thereof in order
to entitle him to sue.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> If, however, the action is at the instance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
of the author of a contribution to a collective work against third
parties, the proper registration would be of the story or article
only with the date of the first publication in the collective work
of such story or article, or if serial, of the first part thereof.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
Against the proprietor, for publishing separately without permission,
the author does not require to be registered, as the
right sued on is not one of copyright but presumably of implied
contract.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> If the owner of the periodical has acquired the entire
copyright in a story or article, he can sue on a registration either
of the first number of the magazine or of the first part of the
story or article.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p><i>The Name and Place of Abode of the Publisher.</i>&mdash;The publisher
to be entered is the first publisher of the book.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> No subsequent
publisher, unless of a revised edition, need be entered on the
register.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> If the publishers are a firm it is sufficient to enter
their firm name, such as <i>Newby &amp; Co.</i>; the individual names
of the members of the firm need not be entered.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> A publisher's
ordinary place of business describes sufficiently his "place of
abode": his private residential address need not be entered.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p><i>The Name and Place of Abode of the Proprietor.</i>&mdash;The proprietor
to be entered is the proprietor at the time of registration,
and it is unnecessary to trace his title from the first proprietor.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
The joinder of the unregistered proprietor as co-plaintiff with a
person who has been erroneously registered, or who, being
rightly registered, is no longer proprietor, will not render an
action for infringement of copyright maintainable.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> It is not
sufficient to register a mere agent or nominee of the proprietor.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
The registered proprietor, however, if legal owner, may sue as
trustee for the equitable owner of the copyright.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> If the plaintiff
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
in an action is the assignee of a former proprietor already registered,
either the assignment must have been by entry in the
register, or the assignment, if made otherwise, must be entered.
In every case the plaintiff, either as proprietor at the date of
registration or as his assignee, must appear on the face of the
register.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> It is probably not necessary to register every mesne
assignment from the proprietor originally registered to the
plaintiff.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> When the original proprietor is registered, and the
assignee from him is subsequently registered, it is necessary
that both entries should be correct, in order to entitle the
assignee to sue.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> If the proprietor has no fixed abode in the
United Kingdom, an address in the United Kingdom through
which he can be conveniently communicated with will probably
be a sufficient compliance with the statute.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>If there is an error in any of the particulars required to be
entered in the register it is fatal to the success of an action,
even although caused by neglect or carelessness on the part
of one of the officials at Stationers' Hall.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> If the necessary
particulars are entered it is immaterial that superfluous matter
is also entered.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p><b>Certificate of Registration.</b>&mdash;The officer appointed by the
Stationers' Company for the purposes of registration under
the Copyright Acts must, whenever reasonably required, give
a copy of any entry in the Book of Registry, certified under
his hand and impressed with the stamp of the Stationers'
Company, to any person on payment of five shillings, and
such copies are to be received in evidence in all Courts,
and are <i>primâ facie</i> proof of the proprietorship or assignment
of copyright or licence, but subject to be rebutted by other
evidence.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Registration does not, however, give a title against
the whole world except the true owner.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span></p>

<p><b>False Entries.</b>&mdash;If any person wilfully makes or causes to
be made any false entry in the Registry Book of the Stationers'
Company, or wilfully produces in evidence any paper falsely
purporting to be a copy of any entry in such book, he will be
guilty of an indictable misdemeanour.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p><b>Rectification of Register.</b>&mdash;If any person "deems himself
aggrieved" by any entry in the Registry Book, he may apply
by motion to the King's Bench Division for an order that such
entry may be expunged or varied.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> An order to expunge will
not be made at the trial of an action:<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> it must be applied for
by motion in accordance with section 14, unless, perhaps, it
is specifically claimed in the statement of claim in the action.
There is probably no appeal from an order to expunge.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> If
a wrong entry has been made in the Book of Registry, the proprietor
of the copyright in the book so erroneously entered is,
even although he has by mistake made the wrong entry himself,
a person aggrieved within the meaning of the statute, and can
apply to the Court for an order to vary such entry.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> An order to
expunge or vary will not be made without definite proof that the
existing entry is erroneous, and that the proposed entry in lieu
thereof is correct.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> By the words "deem himself aggrieved" the
legislature did not mean that any person who said he was aggrieved
could apply: the applicant must show to the Court that
he has a right to consider himself aggrieved.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> When the copyright
in a book is in dispute either party claiming the right is
a party aggrieved.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> If a non-copyright book is entered on
the register, probably any one who wished to copy it would be
a party aggrieved;<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> but it is not open to any one to make
application to the Court on the ground of technical flaws in a
registration.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> The applicant, unless he claims the copyright,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
must be able to show a substantial defect on the merits of the
registered proprietor's title.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>When once an entry on the register has been struck out,
the Court has probably no power to restore it.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section VI.&mdash;Delivery of Copies to Libraries.</span></h3>

<p>Copies of all books first published in the United Kingdom
after 1842 must be delivered to the undermentioned libraries
by the publisher. In default the respective librarians may
recover from the publisher:<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
    <span class="i0"><span class="rgt">i.</span> The value of the copy which ought to have been delivered.</span>
    <span class="i0"><span class="rgt">ii.</span> A sum not exceeding £5.</span>
    <span class="i0"><span class="rgt">iii.</span> Solicitor and client costs.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The proceedings may either be summary by way of conviction
before two Justices of the Peace in the county or place
where the publisher making default resides, or by action in any
Court of Record in the United Kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>The following copies are to be delivered:</p>

<p class="i2">I. <i>To the British Museum</i>:<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">One of the best copies published (complete with maps
and prints) of</p>

    <span class="i0"><span class="rgt">i.</span> Every book first published.</span>
    <span class="i0"><span class="rgt">ii.</span> Every subsequent edition of a book, unless</span>
    <span class="i2"><span class="rgt">(<i>a</i>)</span> it contains no additions or alterations, and</span>
    <span class="i2"><span class="rgt">(<i>b</i>)</span> some preceding edition has been delivered:</span>
</div></div>

<p class="hang">Within one calendar month after publication or offering
for sale in London.</p>

<p class="hang">Within three calendar months after publication or offering
for sale elsewhere in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p class="hang">The copy must be delivered between 10 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> and 4 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> on
any day except Sunday, Ash Wednesday, Good Friday,
and Christmas Day.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p class="hang">The officer of the Museum appointed to receive these
copies is required to give a receipt in writing.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="i2">II. <i>To each of the following Libraries</i>,<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> <i>or to Stationers' Hall for their use</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The Bodleian Library at Oxford.</span>
<span class="i2">The Public Library at Cambridge.</span>

person authorised thereto by the respective libraries.</p>

<p class="hang">The officer at Stationers' Hall and librarians of the
several libraries are required to give a receipt in
writing when a copy of a book is delivered to them.</p></blockquote>

<p>The clauses as to delivery of copies are to be considered as
being strictly penal. In <i>The British Museum</i> v. <i>Payne</i>,<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> under the
similar provisions in 54 Geo. III. c. 156, it was held that when a
book was published in parts, a single part was not demandable.
The Court refused to consider the question when, if ever, the
complete book would be demandable.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that neither the copyright nor the right
to sue is affected by non-delivery of these copies. The only consequence
of omission to do so is a penalty on the publisher.</p>

<p>The right of the various bodies to delivery of a copy applies
to all books published within the United Kingdom and not only
to those entered at Stationers' Hall.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section VII.&mdash;Duration of Protection.</span></h3>

<p>Protection dates from first publication.</p>

<p><i>Generally.</i>&mdash;The period of protection is for the natural life
of the author and for seven years after his death, or for forty-two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
years from the date of publication, whichever period shall
be longer.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p><i>Posthumous Works</i> are protected for forty-two years from the
date of publication.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p><i>Encyclopædias</i> are protected for the life of the proprietor and
seven years (by 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45, sec. 18, the proprietor of a
collective work enjoys the same rights as if he were the actual
author thereof), or for forty-two years from the date of publication,
whichever period shall be the longer.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p><i>Reviews</i>, <i>Magazines</i>, <i>and other periodical works of a like nature</i><a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
have two separate copyrights, viz.:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">i.</span> The proprietor's copyright in the publication, as a whole,
for his life and seven years, or forty-two years from first
publication.</span>

<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">ii.</span> The contributor's copyright in his separate contribution
as a separate work, beginning twenty-eight years after
publication of the collective work, or on separate
publication, if such should by agreement take place
within the twenty-eight years, and lasting for his life
and seven years, or forty-two years from first publication
in the collective work.</span>
</div></div>

<p><i>New Editions.</i><a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>&mdash;As to each edition, the copyright runs from
the date of publication thereof, in so far as the matter therein is
then first published.</p>

<p><i>Joint Works.</i>&mdash;Although there is no statutory provision, they
are probably protected for the life of the surviving author and
seven years, or for forty-two years from first publication.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section VIII.&mdash;Copyright in Lectures.</span></h3>

<p>There is no lecturing right, <i>i. e.</i> no exclusive statutory right to
deliver a lecture in public. The only Act applying to lectures is
5 &amp; 6 Will. IV. c. 65, which, under pain of penalties, prohibits
printing or publishing, or knowingly selling lectures, which at
the time of delivery have not been published in book form,
without leave of the author thereof, or of the person to whom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
the author thereof has sold or otherwise conveyed the same.
The remedy is action in the High Court for: (i) Forfeiture of
copies. (ii) One penny per copy; half to the Crown and half to
informer. A condition precedent of protection under this Act is
the giving of notice in writing to two justices living within five
miles from the place where such lecture or lectures are delivered,
two days at least before delivering the same. The Act
has fallen into entire desuetude, partly, no doubt, on account of
this somewhat troublesome stipulation as to notice, but principally
because a lecturer has, in fact, full protection at common
law, if, as is usually the case, he can make out an implied contract
between himself and his audience that the delivery of the
lecture is for purposes of instruction only, and that those present
are entitled to make no other use of it whatsoever.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> His remedy
at common law will be for damages and injunction. Of course
he cannot sue for penalties, unless he has brought himself within
the Act.</p>

<p>The Lectures Act does not apply so as to protect any lecture
or lectures delivered in any university, or public school or
college, or on any public foundation, or by any individual in
virtue of, or according to, any gift, endowment, or foundation.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
The law relating to such lectures is declared to be the same as if
the Lectures Act had not been passed. The result of this proviso
is that these special kinds of lectures are nearly always protected
at common law by implied contract in the same way as
other lectures.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

THE OWNER OF THE COPYRIGHT IN BOOKS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section I.&mdash;The Crown.</span></h3>

<p>When the Crown ceased to have the complete control which
it originally exercised over the printing-press, it still claimed to
retain, as its prerogative, the exclusive right of printing such
works as it considered its own peculiar property.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> These
included the authorised translation of the Bible, the Common
Prayer Book, Acts of Parliament<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> and Proclamations,<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Latin
Grammars and Year Books. Law books, such as "Rolle's
Abridgment," and reports collected by the judges were also
claimed by the Crown on the ground that the laws were the
King's Laws. Classical books, almanacs and the like, were
claimed by the Crown as <i>bona nullius</i> and things derelict. As
regards those books which the Crown claimed as its own
property, it granted licences and patents. The Stationers'
Company, the King's printers, the Universities, and from time
to time various individuals received grants of authority to print
such works.</p>

<p>Many of the claims, for instance, to almanacs, law reports,
Latin grammars, have for long been abandoned. The
patentees of the Crown, however, still claim a prerogative
copyright in&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. The Authorised English Translation of the Bible.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></span>

<span class="i0">2. The Book of Common Prayer.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and the King's
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
printers have each the right to print the Bible and the Prayer
Book.</p>

<p>No objection has ever been taken on behalf of the Crown or
her patentees to the printing of the Bible with notes, and this is
in practice constantly done without authority. The notes, however,
must be substantial and not merely illusory.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>In 1887 the Treasury published a Minute<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> in which the
claims of the Crown to the exclusive right of publishing Government
publications are set out. The Minute was published in
the <i>London Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>The following publications are declared to be free from
restriction of any kind, and any person may therefore publish
them with or without notes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. Reports of Select Committees of the Two Houses of
Parliament, or of Royal Commissions.</span>

<span class="i0">2. Papers required by Statute to be laid before Parliament,
<i>e. g.</i> Orders in Council, Rules made by Government
Departments, Accounts, Reports of Government
Inspectors.</span>

<span class="i0">3. Papers laid before Parliament by Command, e. g.
Treaties, Diplomatic Correspondence, Reports from
Consuls and Secretaries of Legation, Reports of Inquiries
into Explosions or Accidents, and other
Special Reports made to Government Departments.</span>

<span class="i0">4. Acts of Parliament.</span>

<span class="i0">5. Official books, <i>e. g.</i> King's Regulations for the Army or
Navy.</span>
</div></div>

<p>In the following works the Government claims to retain the
copyright:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. Literary or quasi-literary works, <i>e. g.</i> the Reports of the
<i>Challenger</i> Expedition, the Rolls Publications, the State
Trials, the "Board of Trade Journal."</span>

<span class="i0">2. Charts and Ordnance Maps.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The ancient prerogative claimed by the Crown was a perpetual
copyright. The Crown is not mentioned in the Copyright
Act, and it is open to doubt whether it could enforce a
perpetual copyright in works compiled by its servants, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
whether it could only claim the term of copyright granted by the
Copyright Act.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section II.&mdash;The Universities.</span></h3>

<p>By an Act of George III.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> provision is made for the vesting
of copyrights in perpetuity in the Universities of Oxford and
Cambridge, the Scottish Universities and the Colleges of Eton,
Westminster, and Winchester. These privileges were obtained
in consequence of the decision in <i>Donaldson</i> v. <i>Beckett</i><a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> in the
House of Lords to the effect that there was no perpetual copyright.</p>

<p>Perpetual Copyright under the Universities' Act attaches to
those books which are "bequeathed or otherwise given" to
one of the Universities or Colleges. A work such as The Revised
Version of the Bible, which was compiled under the direction
and at the expense of the two Universities, will probably not
have perpetual copyright under the Act since it is neither bequeathed
nor given. The same would apply to copyrights
purchased by a university or college.</p>

<p>The book in which University privilege is claimed must be
registered within two months after the time when the bequest or
gift of the copyright comes to the knowledge of the Vice-Chancellor
of the University or head of the college, as the case
may be.</p>

<p>The remedy against unauthorised printing or importing or
knowingly selling, publishing, or exposing for sale any book in
which there is University copyright is an action in the High
Court for&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(<i>a</i>) Forfeiture for destruction.</span>

<span class="i0">(<i>b</i>) One penny for every sheet found in the custody of the
infringer, half to go to the Crown and half to the informer.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The perpetual privilege granted by the Act only subsists so
long as the book is printed only within the respective Universities
or Colleges, and for their sole benefit and advantage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
This does not debar them from selling the copyright, but if sold
it will only subsist for the term granted to authors by the
Copyright Act, 1842.</p>

<p><i>Quære</i> if some of Jowett's works, for instance, were printed
in the United States in order to acquire American copyright,
whether that would destroy the perpetual copyright by reason
of copies being printed outside the University.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section III.&mdash;The Author.</span></h3>

<p>Copyright in every book published in the lifetime of the
author thereof "shall be the property of such author and his
assigns."<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Copyright therefore in the first instance ordinarily
vests in the author. The word author is not defined in the Act,
and from time to time difficult questions have arisen as to who
is the author of a particular book within the meaning of the
Act. Difficulties have generally arisen from the fact that two or
more people have been engaged in the production of a book.
The rule appears to be that, if the literary matter is composed
by those who make the manuscript,<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> the author is the man
from whom emanates the general conception and design, and
that although much of the detail may have been the work of
subordinate brains and hands, he is the author of the entirety,
and may sue for any infringement of it. Thus in <i>Scott</i> v. <i>Stanford</i>,<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
where the plaintiff compiled and published periodically
statistical returns of the London coal market, Page Wood, V. C.,
in giving judgment, said that it appeared to him quite immaterial
whether the plaintiff had been assisted in the compilation by his
own clerks or by those of the Corporation. In <i>Barfield</i> v.
<i>Nicholson</i><a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> a case under the statute of Anne, Leach, V. C., said
that he was of opinion that under the statute the one who
formed the plan and embarked on the speculation of a work,
and employed various persons to compose different parts of it
adapted to their own peculiar acquirements, was the author and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
proprietor of the work, if not within the literal expression, at least
within the equitable meaning of the statute of Anne. In <i>Hatton</i>
v. <i>Kean</i><a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> the defendant had arranged certain of Shakespeare's
plays with adjuncts of scenery, music, dancing, &amp;c., and employed
artists and authors to aid him in carrying his design into
effect; amongst others, the plaintiff was employed to compose
and arrange the orchestral accompaniments. The Court of
Common Pleas held that the defendant was the author of the
entire production. Erle, C. J., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am of opinion that the music so composed by the direction and
under the superintendence of the defendant, and as part of the general
plan of the spectacle, must, as between him and the plaintiff, become the
property of the defendant, and that consequently the defendant has
violated no right of the plaintiff in causing it to be represented in the
manner alleged."<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Wallerstein</i> v. <i>Herbert</i>,<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> where the facts were similar to those
in <i>Hatton</i> v. <i>Kean</i>,<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> that case was approved by the Court of
Queen's Bench. Cockburn, C. J., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Looking at the nature of this composition, it is clear that it became
a part and parcel of the drama, and was not an independent composition."</p></blockquote>

<p>These decisions seem equally applicable to books which are
not dramatic compositions, but <i>quære</i> whether <i>Hatton</i> v. <i>Kean</i><a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
did not go too far. It seems a strange thing to say that the
arranger of a play becomes the author of, <i>inter alia</i>, the musical
accompaniment of which, perhaps, he could not have composed
a single bar. Would, for instance, the author of a book be also
the author of illustrations which he had procured another to
draw for him? Kekewich, J., in <i>Petty</i> v. <i>Taylor</i>, thought
not.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>The mere suggestion of a subject or idea which is then
entirely designed and executed by another does not constitute
the originator of the idea an author, even although the actual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
composer is his employee.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> In <i>Shepherd</i> v. <i>Conquest</i><a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> the
plaintiffs, proprietors of a theatre, employed a "stock author"
who, on payment of a weekly salary and travelling expenses,
composed plays for them. Under this employment the author
composed "Old Joe and Young Joe," a dramatic piece, which
he handed over to the plaintiffs, and which was produced by
them at their theatre. There was no contract or assignment
in writing, but there was an oral understanding that the plaintiffs
should have the sole right of representing the piece in
London. It was held in the Court of Common Pleas that the
plaintiffs had acquired no title under the Dramatic Copyright
Act, 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15, by reason of which they could sue an
infringement of the performing right.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Jervis, C. J., delivered
the judgment of the Court:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We do not think it necessary in the present case to express any
opinion whether, under any circumstances, the copyright in a literary
work or the right of representation can become vested <i>ab initio</i> in an
employer other than the person who has actually composed or adapted a
literary work. It is enough to say in the present case that no such effect
can be produced when the employer merely suggests the subject, and has
no share in the design or execution of the work. It appears to us an
abuse of terms to say that in such a case the employer is the author of a
work to which his mind has not contributed an idea."</p></blockquote>

<p>There may be joint authorship of a book. To constitute
joint authorship the work must be produced by joint labour in
prosecution of a preconceived joint design. In <i>Levy</i> v. <i>Rutley</i><a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
A wrote a play, to which subsequently B added a scene, and
made a few alterations and additions in other parts of the piece.
It was held that there was not joint authorship. Byles, J.,
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If the piece had been originally written by A and B jointly in prosecution
of a preconcerted joint design, the two might have been said to be
the co-authors of the whole play, notwithstanding that different portions
were respectively the sole productions of either."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span></p>

<p>And Keating, J., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I entirely agree with my brother Byles that though it may not be
necessary that each should contribute the same amount of labour, there
must be a joint labouring in furtherance of a common design."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Quære</i> whether co-authors are joint owners with the right of
survivorship. In <i>Marzials</i> v. <i>Gibbons</i><a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> it was suggested that they
were, but see the decisions where co-assignees are held to be
owners in common, or part owners without the right of survivorship.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
<i>Quære</i> also whether each co-author, as is the case with
each co-assignee,<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> is entitled to sue in respect of an invasion
without the concurrence of the other co-author or co-authors.</p>

<p>Until <i>Walter</i> v. <i>Lane</i><a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> was decided in the House of Lords,
it was a prevalent opinion that the author must be he who
actually designs and by himself or through others composes the
literary matter contained in the book. That case, however,
demonstrates that the author is the first producer of literary
matter in "book" form, <i>i. e.</i> in some permanent form from which
it can be copied by the printer's compositor, usually, but not
necessarily, manuscript. As a rule such person is also the composer
of the literary matter contained in the book, but this is not
a necessary attribute of the character of author. In <i>Walter</i> v.
<i>Lane</i><a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Lord Rosebery had delivered without reserve of any kind
certain public speeches. They were delivered orally, not having
been previously committed to writing. On the various occasions
when they were delivered reporters from the <i>Times</i> were present,
and they took down the speeches verbatim. From these reports
they were transcribed into long hand, and published in the
<i>Times</i>. Mr. Lane, a publisher, took these speeches from the
columns of the <i>Times</i>, and without any authority from the proprietors
thereof, published them in a volume entitled "Appreciations
and Addresses, by Lord Rosebery." In this action at the
instance of the proprietors of the <i>Times</i> for the infringement of
the copyright in their reports, it was finally held in the House of
Lords, firstly, that as these reports contained literary matter published
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
for the first time in "book" form, they were the subject of
copyright, and secondly, that the reporters were the authors within
the meaning of the Act, since they first reduced the literary
matter orally delivered by Lord Rosebery to "book" form.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section IV.&mdash;The Employer.</span></h3>

<p><b>Under Section 18.</b>&mdash;An employer is <i>ab initio</i> entitled to the
copyright when he employs an author within the meaning of
and subject to the conditions imposed by section 18. Section
18<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> enacts that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When any publisher or other person shall before or at the time of
the passing of the Act have projected, conducted, and carried on, or shall
hereafter project, conduct, and carry on, or be the proprietor of any
encyclopædia, review, magazine, periodical work, or work published in a
series of books or parts, or any book whatsoever, and shall have employed
or shall employ any persons to compose the same in any volumes, parts,
essays, articles, or portions thereof for publication in or as part of the
same, and such works, volumes, parts, essays, articles, or portions, shall
have been or shall hereafter be composed under such employment on the
terms that the copyright therein shall belong to such proprietor, projector,
publisher, or conductor, and paid for by such proprietor, projector, publisher,
or conductor, the copyright in every such encyclopædia, review,
magazine, periodical work, and work published in a series of books or
parts, and every volume, part, essay, article, and portion so composed and
paid for shall be the property of such proprietor, projector, publisher, or
other conductor, who shall enjoy the same rights as if he were the actual
author thereof, and shall have such term of copyright therein as is given
to the authors of books by this Act; except only that in the case of essays,
articles, or portions forming part of and first published in reviews,
magazines, and other periodical works of a like nature, after the term of
twenty-eight years from the first publication thereof respectively, the right
of publishing the same in a separate form shall revert to the author for the
remainder of the term given by this Act: provided always that during the
term of twenty-eight years the said proprietor shall not publish any such
essay, article, or portion separately or singly without the consent previously
obtained of the author thereof or his assigns: provided also that nothing
herein contained shall alter or affect the right of any person who shall
have been or who shall be so employed as aforesaid to publish any such his
composition in a separate form, who by any contract, express or implied,
may have reserved or may hereafter reserve to himself such right; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
every author reserving, retaining, or having such right, shall be entitled to
the copyright in such composition when published in a separate form,
according to this Act, without prejudice to the right of such proprietor,
projector, publisher, or conductor, as aforesaid."</p></blockquote>

<p>The nature of a proprietor's rights in the articles contributed
to his periodical under section 18 is well summarised by Chitty, J.,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This 18th section when fairly examined comes to this: the author of
a literary work is the proprietor of the copyright under the general sections
of the Act. If it is unpublished matter, probably the better term is to say
that his right is to prevent any one else from publishing. If it is published
matter, then his right is a true copyright, and it is to prevent anybody
else from multiplying copies, and that right is vested in him....
Then comes this 18th section, the short effect of which is to transfer for
a limited period a portion of the copyright to the proprietor of the periodical
for whom the article has been composed; it being a condition that
there shall not only be a composition of the article on the terms that it
shall belong to the proprietor or publisher, but also that the sum agreed
to be paid has been paid."<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Scope of Section.</i>&mdash;In some of the earlier cases it seems to be
suggested that section 18 applies only to works of a periodical
nature.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> But this gives no meaning to the words "or any book
whatsoever," which surely could not be construed as including
only books <i>ejusdem generis</i> as periodicals. The first part of the
section appears to include all books if produced under the conditions
as to employment and payment there enacted.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> The
judgment in <i>Shepherd</i> v. <i>Conquest</i><a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> suggests that in the opinion of
the Court in that case section 18 did not apply when the performing
right in a play was claimed by the proprietors of a
theatre, the play having been produced by a "stock author" in
their employment. It is difficult to see why section 18 should
not be equally applicable to the performing right as to the copyright.
Section 20 of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45 provides that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The provisions hereinbefore enacted in respect of the property of
such copyright and of registering the same shall apply to the liberty of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
representing or performing any dramatic piece or musical composition as
if the same were herein expressly re-enacted and applied thereto, save and
except that the first public representation or performance of any dramatic
piece or musical composition shall be deemed equivalent in the construction
of this Act to the first publication of any book."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Under such Employment.</i>&mdash;The author must be "employed"
and the work must be composed "under such employment." It
appears therefore that a work or part of a work would not come
within this 18th section unless actually executed in the course of
the author's employment by the proprietor. In other words,
there must be antecedent employment.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> A contribution voluntarily
sent to a magazine would not, even although accepted and
paid for on the terms that the copyright should belong to the
proprietors, come under the provisions of section 18. It is submitted
that it would become the sole property of the proprietor
of the magazine for all purposes without any reservation of the
right of separate publication to the author.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>If A employs B, who in his turn employs C, the copyright
will vest in A if B acted as a mere agent for A. Thus in
<i>Stubbs</i> v. <i>Howard</i>,<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Stubbs employed the Mercantile Press to
obtain the necessary information for their Gazette, and the Mercantile
Press employed P. to collect and compile. It was held that
the copyright vested <i>ab initio</i> in Stubbs under section 18. But
if A employs and pays B to do certain literary work, and B, of
his own authority, employs and pays C, D, and E to do certain
portions of it, it is doubtful whether the copyright in these
portions will vest in A under section 18. The author has been
neither employed nor paid by the proprietor of the work since B
acted not as an agent for him, but as an independent contractor.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
The operation of section 18 seems to be exhausted in the first
employment.</p>

<p>"<i>On the terms that the copyright therein shall belong to such
proprietor.</i>"&mdash;The terms may be implied from the nature of the
employment and the circumstances under which the work is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
composed. In <i>Sweet</i> v. <i>Benning</i><a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> various members of the bar
had furnished reports of cases to the plaintiffs, the proprietors
of the <i>Jurist</i>. The reporters selected what cases they thought fit
to report and were paid for their work. The arrangements were
entirely oral, and nothing seems to have been said about copyright.
The Court of Common Pleas held that the proprietors of
the <i>Jurist</i> became the owners of the copyright under the 18th
section. Maule, J., in support of his opinion said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When a man employs another to write an article or to do anything
else for him, unless there is something in the surrounding circumstances
or in the course of dealing between the parties to require a different construction,
in the absence of a special agreement to the contrary, it is to be
understood that the writing or other thing is produced upon the terms
that the copyright therein shall belong to the employer."</p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Trade Auxiliary</i> v. <i>Middlesborough</i><a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> the proprietors of <i>Stubbs'
Weekly Gazette</i> and two other weekly papers jointly employed
on salary two men to examine the official records and extract
the particulars of bills of sale and deeds of arrangement registered
in accordance with the Acts. The information so obtained
was published in the weekly papers. It was held that the proprietors
of the respective papers became owners of the copyright
under section 18. In <i>Lamb</i> v. <i>Evans</i><a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> the plaintiff employed and
paid several persons in canvassing for advertisements and
arranging them under appropriate headings in a Trades Directory.
Lindley, L. J., in giving judgment, said he thought that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The burthen of proof was on the plaintiff to show that the headings
were composed upon the terms that the copyright therein should belong
to him; but the statute does not say anything about the kind of evidence
which is to be adduced for the purpose of proving that an article has been
composed on these terms.... If there is no express agreement the question
is, what is the inference to be drawn from the circumstances of the
case. In drawing the inference regard must be had to the nature of the
articles which are here merely the headings to groups of advertisements
with translations, and the view expressed by Mr. Justice Maule in <i>Sweet</i> v.
<i>Benning</i><a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> may be very safely acted upon, viz. that <i>primâ facie</i> at all events
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
you will infer, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, from the fact of
employment and payment that one of the terms was that the copyright
should belong to the employer. That is not a necessary inference; but
in a case of this sort, where any other inference would be unbusinesslike,
I should not hesitate myself to draw that inference."</p></blockquote>

<p>Bowen, L. J., in the same case, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"From where are you to collect the terms? You may collect them
from what passed between the parties, that is to say between the plaintiff
and the persons whom he employed, but you may also collect them from
the nature of the business itself, and it seems to me to be impossible as a
matter of business to suppose that these headings were composed and
furnished to the plaintiff upon any other terms than that he was to have
the copyright in them, because otherwise those who composed them
having furnished them to the plaintiff might themselves have published
them and defeated his object."</p></blockquote>

<p>On the other hand in <i>Walter</i> v. <i>Howe</i>,<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Jessel, M. R., held
that the <i>Times</i> could not sue in respect of a biography of Lord
Beaconsfield which had appeared in their columns. There was
evidence that the author had been paid for his literary services,
but there was apparently no evidence as to whether he had been
"employed" "on the terms that the copyright should belong"
to the plaintiff. Notice that in this case no antecedent employment
whatsoever is shown. In <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Newnes</i><a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> a series of
stories were contributed to the <i>Weekly Dispatch</i> under an
arrangement between the proprietor and the author. The
author was not on the permanent staff of the <i>Weekly Dispatch</i>.
He was paid by the proprietors for his contributions, the
arrangement being that the author should have the right of
separately publishing the stories, provided such separate publication
did not take place until after all the stories had appeared
in the <i>Weekly Dispatch</i>. In an action by the author against an
infringer, Romer, J., in giving judgment for the plaintiff, said that
he had come to the conclusion that although the plaintiff was
paid he was not paid on the terms that the copyright in the
stories should belong to the proprietors of the journal. The
author had therefore not parted with the copyright and was the
proper plaintiff.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>

<p>In <i>Aflalo</i> v. <i>Lawrence</i><a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> the defendants published a work called
"The Encyclopædia of Sport." A, one of the plaintiffs, agreed
with the defendants that he would edit the work. He was to
receive £500 for his services, and to write without further remuneration
7000 words of special articles. He was entitled to
pursue his literary work in so far as it did not interfere with the
performance of his duties. A contributed an article to the
encyclopædia under this agreement. A, by the request of the
defendants, procured C, the other plaintiff, to write certain
articles for the encyclopædia at the rate of £2 per thousand
words. The articles of both plaintiffs were published in the
encyclopædia. Joyce, J., held that the contributions of neither
plaintiff came within section 18, since there was nothing to show
that they were contributed on the terms that the copyright
therein should belong to the defendants. The defendants were
therefore not entitled to publish the plaintiff's articles in any
other form than as part of the encyclopædia. In view of the
earlier authorities I think this decision is extremely doubtful.</p>

<p><i>Joint Employers.</i>&mdash;As has been seen above in the case of
<i>Trade Auxiliary</i> v. <i>Middlesborough</i>,<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> two or more proprietors of
several periodicals may jointly employ an author so as to acquire
the copyright under this section. Each has a separate copyright
in his respective paper, and, although the matter contributed to
the several papers is the same, may sue without joining the other
proprietors. Each is "a transferee by virtue of section 18 of
a limited portion of the copyright in that particular composition."<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p><i>Payment.</i>&mdash;Not only must there be employment for reward,
but payment is a condition precedent. If payment is not proved
the section will not operate to transfer the copyright from the
author.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Payment must be made before the commencement of
an action.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> It has been suggested that it must be made before
piracy, and this appears a sound view since there is no copyright
in the proprietor until payment, and an infringement before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
copyright is assigned is no cause of action in the assignee.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
There is nothing to suggest that payment must be made before
publication.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p><i>Author's Separate Rights.</i>&mdash;When an author has contributed
to a periodical and the conditions of the section have been fulfilled
so as to vest the copyright in the proprietor of the periodical,
it would seem that for twenty-eight years, <i>i. e.</i> until the right of
publishing in separate form reverts to the author, the author has
no right to sue third parties in respect of an infringement without
joining the proprietor of the periodical as co-plaintiff. If, however,
the author, while contributing on the terms that the proprietor
should have the copyright, reserves the right of publishing
his composition in a separate form within the meaning of the
proviso at the end of the section, when he does publish in
separate form he will be entitled to copyright concurrently with
the proprietor, but semble that he will have no right to sue
alone until publication in separate form,<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> or until the lapse of
twenty-eight years.</p>

<p>During the twenty-eight years the proprietor of a periodical
work is not, apart from express agreement, entitled to publish the
contribution in separate form. If the proprietor does publish
separately in breach of the provision of the section, the author
has a right of action against him, and the author's right not
being one of copyright but in respect of a breach of implied
or statutory contract he does not require to be registered.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
"Separate" means in any other form than the original collective
publication, whether as a single work by itself or in conjunction
with other matter. When the proprietor of a magazine reprinted
certain stories which had appeared in the magazine from time
to time, and published them as a supplement to the current
number, this was held to be a publication in separate form
which the author could prevent.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> So also the republication of
the Christmas number of a periodical under a different title,
form, and price, is a separate publication of an article contained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
in such number.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> A Christmas number of a serial publication,
although published in an entirely different form with separate
pagination and sold at a different price from the ordinary
numbers, is part of the periodical, and separate publication
of the stories therein will be prohibited under section 18.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>An article may be contributed to a periodical under express
or implied terms that the copyright shall belong to the proprietor
for all purposes, in which case there will be no reservation of a
right of separate publication.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>It should be clearly noted that the second part of section 18
applies only to periodical works. Therefore in the case of an
encyclopædia or similar collective works the owner has, apart
from special terms, a right to publish the contributor's article
separately from the original publication.</p>

<p><b>Employer's Rights where Section 18 does not Apply.</b>&mdash;A
question of some difficulty has been raised from time to time to
which there is no definite authoritative answer, viz. whether apart
from the provisions of section 18 the copyright ever vests
<i>ab initio</i> in the employer of an author. We shall see in dealing
with assignment that probably the sole right before publication
to acquire the copyright of a book on first publication may pass
from the author to his assignee without writing, either by an
implied gift on delivery of the manuscript or by express oral
assignment. The question now considered is whether by the
fact of employment alone the work of the employee may not
<i>ipso facto</i> on production become the property of his employer.
In <i>Sweet</i> v. <i>Benning</i><a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> it was held that the employment of certain
members of the bar as reporters came within section 18, and
that the copyright vested in the employers themselves; but
during the argument Maule, J., is reported to have said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"One might almost infer without the aid of an Act of Parliament that
one who employs another to write an article or to make anything else for
him is the owner or proprietor."</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that this suggestion is wrong if applied to the case of an
independent contractor, and that if such an employment does not
come within section 18 there will be no proprietary right in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
employer <i>ab initio</i>, although it may be transferred to him before
publication by mere delivery of the manuscript with the mutual
intention to convey all rights. But in the case of a servant or
agent who produces literary work in the course of his employment,
I think it is different. I think that his work will vest
<i>ab initio</i> irrespective of section 18, and that section 18 only
applies to an independent contractor and not to a servant. In
<i>Hildesheimer</i> v. <i>Dunn</i><a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> Kekewich, J., takes this view. He
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I entertain a strong opinion that when a person has composed verses,
we will say on behalf of another, that is to say as his servant or agent,
whether for pay or not, the person on whose behalf such verses are composed
is properly registered under the Act as the proprietor, notwithstanding
that there is no assignment in writing or indeed any assignment
at all."</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section V.&mdash;The Assignee.</span></h3>

<p><b>Before Publication.</b>&mdash;Before a manuscript has been published
the right to publish and acquire the copyright may be
assigned so that on publication the copyright will be the
property of the assignee. If the publication takes place during
the lifetime of the author, the assignee takes the copyright under
sections 2 and 3 of the Copyright Act, 1842.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Section 3 provides
"that the copyright in every book which shall, after the
passing of the Act, be published in the lifetime of its author ...
shall be the property of such author and his assigns." Section 2
provides that the word "assigns" shall be "construed to
mean and include every person in whom the interest of an
author in copyright shall be vested, whether derived from such
author before or after the publication of any book, and whether
acquired by sale, gift, bequest, or by operation of law or otherwise."
If the publication takes place after the death of the
author, the assignee takes the copyright under section 3, which
enacts that "the copyright in every book which shall be published
after the death of its author ... shall be the property of
the proprietor of the author's manuscript from which such book
shall first be published and his assigns." The possession and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
right of property in the manuscript is <i>primâ facie</i> proof of the
right to publish and acquire copyright, but such proof may be
rebutted by showing that the possession or ownership of the
manuscript has been separated from the right to publish and
acquire copyright. Thus in the case of letters the literary
property remains in the writer and his assigns, whereas the
property in the physical substance of the manuscript has passed
to the receiver and his assigns.</p>

<p>If an assignment of manuscript, purporting to carry with
it the right to publish and acquire copyright, is made before
publication, it is submitted that no writing is required. The
requirement that an assignment of copyright after publication
must be in writing is founded not on an express enactment,
but on implication from section 15 of the Copyright Act, 1842.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
This section prohibits the reproduction of any book in which
there is subsisting copyright without the consent in writing of
the proprietor thereof. From this it is deduced by <i>a fortiori</i>
argument that an assignment of subsisting copyright must be
in writing.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> It does not in the least follow that the common
law right in manuscript may not be assigned by any mode
by which property of that description might be assigned at
common law. The Courts have not, however, sufficiently distinguished
between an assignment before and an assignment
after publication, and as a result the case law on the subject
is in a most unsatisfactory condition. There are several cases
under the statute of Anne, which statute, in very similar words
to the statute of Victoria, provides that copyright shall belong
to the author and his assignee or assigns. There is no definition
of "assigns," as in the statute of Victoria, but the rule
that assignment of copyright must be in writing is deduced in
the same way from the proviso that consent to copy must be
in writing. The cases under the statute of Anne should therefore
be equally applicable as authorities under the statute of
Victoria. In <i>Clementi</i> v. <i>Walker</i><a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> a French author had assigned
orally to an English subject the exclusive right of
printing and publishing a musical composition in this country.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
The work had not been published in England, and apart altogether
from the question of a prior publication in France, the
Court was of opinion that the publication in England did not
give copyright to the English publisher, "because there was
not any assignment or consent in writing given to the author
previously to that publication. The case of <i>Power</i> v. <i>Walker</i><a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
is an authority to show that a parole assignment is not sufficient
to give to the assignee the privileges conferred by the legislature
upon the author." In <i>Colburn</i> v. <i>Duncombe</i><a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> there was
a written publishing agreement whereby the author agreed to
write a book and assign the whole copyright therein. On
completion the manuscript was delivered to the publisher, and
the author gave a written receipt for the consideration and
agreed to deliver a regular assignment when called upon. This
was never done, and in an action by the publisher against an
infringer it was held that he could not sue without the author
in whom the copyright had vested and remained. In <i>Sweet</i> v.
<i>Shaw</i><a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> the plaintiffs agreed with A and B that A and B should
report cases for them. A and B accordingly took notes of
cases, and these were printed and published by the plaintiffs.
Shadwell, V. C., said that he thought the plaintiffs had a copyright
in equity but not in law. "I cannot," he said, "see how
the agreement that persons shall prepare a work for the plaintiffs
gives the plaintiffs a copyright in law, for there can be no assignment
in law except of that which actually exists." In all these
three cases last cited it is submitted that the whole right of the
author should have been held to have passed to the publisher
by the delivery to him of the manuscript with the mutual
intention that he should acquire all rights therein. The first
case in which it is recognised that the author's right may before
publication pass without writing is <i>Jefferys</i> v. <i>Boosey</i>.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Erle, J.,<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
and Coleridge, J.,<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> decided that no writing was required. Speaking
of an oral assignment abroad of a manuscript subsequently
published here, Coleridge, J., said: "The assignee is clearly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
within the enabling clause of the statute (8 Anne, c. 19); he
is the assignee of an author, and even if these words may in
some cases mean an assignee under an instrument in writing
attested by two witnesses, it has not been shown or decided
that they must or can mean this in all cases. I think the contrary
has been shown. Larger words and less restrained the
legislature could scarcely have used, and on what sound principle
are we to import a restraint by implication?" Lord St. Leonards,
however, in the same case, seemed to be of opinion that the
assignment must be in writing and attested by two witnesses
(under 8 Anne, c. 19) even although made before publication.
In some of the cases the publisher with whom the author has
agreed that he shall have the whole copyright, but to whom
there has been no assignment in writing, has been said to be
an equitable owner of the copyright.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> But it is submitted that
if the manuscript passes before publication with mutual intention
to convey to the publisher all right, title, and interest
therein, the publisher is the legal assignee, and on publication
is the legal owner of the copyright, and there is no necessity
for a formal assignment in writing.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> The same principle may
not apply to performing rights in dramatic and musical works
under 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15. It is probable that statutory
performing rights vest in the author on production,<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> and if this
is so there would probably be no common law performing
right, and therefore no common law assignment; the statutory
mode of assignment would attach from the beginning.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p><b>After Publication.</b>&mdash;After publication an assignment must be
in writing.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> It need not be by deed nor attested by witnesses,<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
nor, it would seem, need it be signed by the proprietor or any
one.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> The assignment may be given by an agent. An assignment
does not require to be registered in order to make it valid
as a transfer of the property: but an assignee who sues must be
registered.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> If the assignor is registered as proprietor complete
assignment may be made by entry on the Book of Registry at
Stationers' Hall.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> Probably an author, even although not
registered, may make a valid assignment by registering the
book in the name of his assignee as proprietor.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> It has been
held that an unregistered author may so register himself and
two others and give all three a title to sue as joint proprietors,
from which it seems to follow that he could have registered the
two others without himself.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> An assignee may make the entry
on the register himself without the concurrence or consent of
his assignor.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>In the case of an assignment made otherwise than by entry
on the register, the writing must in itself amount to a present
conveyance of the copyright although no particular words of
conveyance are required. An executory contract to assign is
not sufficient,<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> neither will it invalidate a subsequent regular
assignment to others.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> A written agreement "to let A have"
a particular drama in discharge of a debt of £10 was held a
complete assignment of all rights in the drama.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> A receipt for
money purporting to be paid in respect of an assignment is not
in itself an assignment.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The copyright will not pass merely by
the sale and transfer of possession of any instrument whereby
the book may be reproduced such as stereotype blocks.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> In the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
event of mesne assignments the burden of proof is in those
disputing the title to show that they were not <i>rite et solenniter
acta</i>;<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> and even in the case of an alleged assignment to a party
in the action, a valid assignment has been presumed from a long
course of dealing without actual evidence of an assignment in
writing.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>An executory contract or a purported assignment not valid at
law will be recognised in equity, and the Court will order specific
performance or compel the assignor to allow the assignee to sue
in the assignor's name.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>The assignee cannot sue in his own name in respect of acts
of infringement committed before he became proprietor.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> An
assignee cannot, apart from special agreement, prevent his
assignor selling against him copies of the book which such
assignor has printed before assignment.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> Probably the assignment
of copyright implies a warranty of the right to convey, free
from encumbrances, and quiet enjoyment.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>Co-assignees take as tenants in common and not as joint
tenants,<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> and any one or more may maintain an action against
a stranger for an infringement of the entire copyright.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> It
follows that one of several co-assignees cannot grant an effective
licence without the concurrence of the others.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>In <i>Jefferys</i> v. <i>Boosey</i><a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> Chief Baron Pollock expressed an
opinion that if a foreigner resident abroad had a copyright in
this country, an assignment valid by the laws of a foreign country
would be sufficient, inasmuch as copyright is expressly enacted
to be personal property, and would therefore pass according to
the laws of the country where the transfer took place.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span></p>

<p><b>Partial Assignment.</b>&mdash;It was laid down in <i>Jefferys</i> v. <i>Boosey</i><a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>
by Lord St. Leonards that copyright was one and indivisible,
and could not be partially assigned. If this is correct, any
attempt to assign a partial right would operate if at all as a mere
licence. This opinion of Lord St. Leonards was in respect of
the statute of Anne. It seems to be more or less accepted that
under the statute of Victoria copyright is divisible; that there
may be partial assignment limited as to place,<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> <i>e. g.</i> provincial
rights, right to publish in a particular country, or limited as to
the nature of the right,<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> <i>e. g.</i> the right to dramatize, the right to
translate. This view appears to be based on section 13 of the
Act of Victoria,<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> which enacts that a registered proprietor may
assign his interest or any portion therein by making entry on
the register. I do not think that this provision in itself is conclusive
or that it necessarily follows that a copyright can be split
up and partially assigned. Section 13 may merely mean that
the owner can assign a certain undivided share in his copyright
to another. Cotton, L. J., in <i>Trade Auxiliary</i> v. <i>Middlesborough</i>,<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
refers to Lord St. Leonards' doctrine. He does not disapprove
of it, but he distinguishes the case of common ownership in a
copyright from the case of a partial assignment as to place.</p>

<p>In a case decided in the Supreme Court of New South
Wales,<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> it was held that the assignee of a performing right
limited to the Australian colonies could sue in his own name
for infringement. The Court distinguished between the performing
right and the copyright. They said that even although the
copyright, in accordance with Lord St. Leonards' opinion, was not
divisible the performing right was.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>In any view of partial assignment I do not think there can
be partial assignment as to time.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Such an assignment would
create an estate in possession and reversion in personal property,
and there is no reason for holding that copyright is any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
exception to the general rule that such an interest cannot be
created in personalty. Equitable estates, limited as to time,
can no doubt be created as in the case of any other personal
property.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> What purports to be an assignment limited as to
time must as a rule be treated as a licence.</p>

<p><b>Assignment distinguished from Licence.</b>&mdash;The distinction between
an assignment and a licence must be carefully observed;
questions of the utmost importance will often depend on
whether a transaction was one or the other. An assignment
is a conveyance of the right denuding the grantor and carrying
to the grantee the whole interest including the right to sue and
the right to re-assign, whereas a licence is only a personal
permission to the grantee to infringe the grantor's right, and
carries with it no right of action except in the grantor's name.
In determining whether a particular transaction is an assignment
or a licence, the first question is whether, on a true
construction of the statute, the right purported to be given
can be given by assignment or only by licence. If the right
is one so limited that it cannot legally be the object of assignment,
the transaction must necessarily be a licence; but if it can
legally be the object of assignment, the further question arises as
to what was the intention of the parties as evidenced by what they
have said and done. There may often be clear words to show
what was intended, but more often it may never have occurred
to the parties that there was any distinction between an assignment
and a licence, and the form used will consequently be
ambiguous. The principal test in such cases is to examine
the contract and the circumstances under which it was made,
and see whether or not it bears the impress of a reliance by
the grantor on the personal skill or reputation of the grantee.
If it does a licence will be presumed rather than an assignment;
for instance, in a publishing agreement a licence only will
be presumed, since either the pocket or the reputation of the
author would suffer if the right of publication were to pass into
incompetent hands.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section VI.&mdash;The Licensee.</span></h3>

<p>Whether a bare licensee can bring an action for infringement
without joining the legal owner of the copyright is open to
doubt. It is submitted that he cannot. The essence of a
licence proper is that it is merely a personal relationship
between a licensor and a licensee whereby the latter is permitted
to infringe the former's copyright. The old cases are
not satisfactory. The distinction between partial assignment
and licence is not clearly drawn, and the result is a confusion of
the respective rights of the assignee and the licensee. In several
cases it was said that licensees could sue<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> but <i>quære</i> whether
they were not really partial assignees. It has also been said
that an owner of copyright who has granted an exclusive licence
cannot sue in respect of an infringement which touches only the
rights included in such licence, unless such owner has the consent
of his licensee.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> This again, it is submitted, is not a
correct statement of the law, and arises from a confusion between
a partial assignee and a licensee. In <i>Taylor</i> v. <i>Neville</i><a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> the
grant of provincial performing rights although called a licence
was really treated as an assignment and distinguished from
a "merely personal licence." It is submitted that a licence
proper is always "merely personal" and that the grantor may sue
without consent of his licensee. Where a licence has been
granted or when there is doubt as to whether a particular grant
is an assignment or a licence, it will always be safer to join both
grantor and grantee as co-plaintiffs. A licence will not be presumed
to be a sole licence, and unless it is expressly stated, or
must necessarily be implied from the circumstances that it is so,
the first licensee cannot restrain the licensor from granting, or a
second licensee from acting on, a second licence.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section VII.&mdash;The Executors or Administrators.</span></h3>

<p>Copyright is personal property, and descends on the death of
an owner to his personal representatives.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> "Assigns" is expressly
interpreted to include one taking by bequest or by operation of
law. The common law property in the manuscript passes on
the death of the owner in the same way as copyright. A bequest
of "all my books" has been held to include valuable manuscript
notes left by a physician.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section VIII.&mdash;The Trustee in Bankruptcy.</span></h3>

<p>Copyright comes within the vesting section of the Bankruptcy
Act and passes to the trustee of a bankrupt owner.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> A bankrupt's
unpublished works, probably, cannot be published for the
benefit of his creditors without his consent.

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

INFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT IN BOOKS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section I.&mdash;Prohibited Acts, and Remedies.</span></h3>

<p>Copyright is defined by the Copyright Act, 1842, as "the sole
and exclusive liberty of printing or otherwise multiplying copies."
Any invasion of this monopoly is an infringement of copyright.
Besides infringement of copyright, <i>i.e</i>. illegal copying, the Act
makes it an offence to deal in certain ways with unlawful copies.
The offences against copyright and the owner's remedies may be
conveniently summarised as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For the following offences:<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">i.</span> Piratical copying.</span>

<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">ii.</span> Importing for sale or hire unlawfully printed books.</span>

<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">iii.</span> Selling or hiring, or having in possession for sale or
hire, unlawfully printed books, knowing the same
to be unlawfully printed.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></span>

<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">iv.</span> Causing any of the above acts to be done.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The remedies<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> are an action in a Court of Record for:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. Damages and account of profits.</span>

<span class="i0">2. Delivery up of copies.</span>

<span class="i0">3. Injunction.</span>
</div></div>

<p>For the following offences:<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">v.</span> Importing without the consent of the proprietor a
foreign copy or copies,<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> <i>i. e.</i> printed outside the
British dominion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span></span>

<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">vi.</span> Selling or hiring or having in possession for sale or
hire foreign copies knowing them to be unlawfully
imported.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>The remedies are:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. Seizure and destruction by any officer of Customs,<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>
and on conviction before two justices of the peace.</span>

<span class="i0">2. £10 for every offence.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></span>

<span class="i0">3. Double the value of every copy dealt with,<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> and</span>
</div></div>

<p>An action in the High Court for</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">4. An injunction.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></span>
</div></div>

</blockquote>

<p><b>Causing to be Printed.</b>&mdash;The prohibition in section 15 is against
"printing, or causing to be printed." Thus the author, publisher,<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
and printer of a piratical book are all equally liable, and it is no
defence for the publisher, who has employed the printer, or for
the printer to say he was acting merely as an innocent agent.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
There may sometimes be difficulty in determining whether a
person who, to a certain extent, is interested in the publication
has yet caused it to be printed within the meaning of the section.
Thus, in the case of <i>Kelly's Directories</i> v. <i>Gavin and Lloyds</i>,<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
the plaintiff had published a directory of merchants and shipping
statistics. The defendant Gavin prepared a similar directory, and
agreed with the defendants Lloyds for its publication. Lloyds
were to print part of it and allow the use of their name in the
title and receive some share in the profits. The book was
accordingly published under the title of "Lloyds' Diary for
Merchants, &amp;c.," and bore on the title-page the statement
"printed at Lloyds, Royal Exchange, London." Part of the
book was held to be an infringement of the plaintiff's copyright;
but it was proved on the trial that that part was not printed by
Lloyds, but by a printer employed by Gavin, and that Lloyds
had no knowledge of its piratical nature. Byrne, J., found that
Lloyds were not partners in the undertaking with Gavin, and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
the printing of the piratical portion was not done by the printer
as their agent. He therefore held that Lloyds had not "caused"
that portion to be printed within the meaning of the section,
and dismissed the action as against Lloyds, but without costs,
as they had allowed their name to appear on the title-page as
printers.</p>

<p><b>Damages.</b>&mdash;An action for damages lies, irrespectively of
sections 15 or 23, for any infringement of copyright as defined
by section 2.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> The damages are damages as for conversion or
detinue,<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> and may be matter for inquiry before a master or
official referee, but frequently are assessed by the judge on a
rough estimate.</p>

<p><b>Account of Profits.</b>&mdash;An order for an account of profits is an
equitable remedy. The defendant is held to have been in possession
of the plaintiff's property, and must account for the profits
thereof.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> The account will be for an account of net profits.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>
On an interlocutory application for an injunction the defendant
may undertake to keep an account of profits until trial; but,
strictly, the right to an account depends on the right to an
injunction, and will not be ordered when the case for an injunction
fails.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> If the defendant's work is not wholly piratical, the
profits must be apportioned according to the relative value of
the piratical with the non-piratical matter. The defendant's
profits may not entirely recoup the plaintiff for the damage he
has suffered, and in that event he is entitled to an inquiry into
damages to supplement his compensation.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p><b>Injunction.</b>&mdash;This is also an equitable remedy. It is not
specially provided for in the Copyright Act, but being the ancillary
remedy in equity for the protection of legal rights, it will be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
granted or withheld according to the discretion of the Courts in
all cases of infringement or other offences against the Act.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>An interim injunction is usually granted on motion before
trial where the plaintiff shows a <i>primâ facie</i> case on affidavit. In
doubtful cases weight will be given to the consideration which
side is more likely to suffer from an erroneous judgment.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> The
Court will consider the balance of convenience on the one side and
the other.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> The reason for granting an interim injunction is that a
continuing infringement might cause damage for which it would
be difficult or impossible to assess an adequate money compensation.
If the taking is of an inconsiderable part, an interim
injunction might not be given, although an injunction might
go at the hearing. In urgent cases an interim injunction may
be granted <i>ex parte</i>. In all interim injunctions the plaintiff
is, as a rule, required to undertake to give compensation to
the defendant if on trial he fails to establish his case.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> When
such an undertaking is given the defendant is, if he succeed
in his defence, entitled to an inquiry as to the damage sustained
on account of the interim injunction against him.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
When there has been undue delay in bringing an action, or
where the conduct of the plaintiff has been such as to induce
the defendant to believe that his conduct would not be objected
to, an interim injunction will probably be refused.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> A mere
expression of opinion by the plaintiff that it would be legal to
make a certain use of his work is not a sufficient ground for
refusing an injunction if in point of law the use made by the
defendant is illegal.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> "Copyright is not to be lost by the mere
expression of opinion."<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> At the hearing of the action a perpetual
injunction will be granted on the plaintiff proving his
title and infringement. Delay or acquiescence not amounting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
to fraud will not prevent an injunction going at the hearing
when the plaintiff proves his right;<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> "for at the hearing of the
cause it is the duty of the Court to decide upon the rights of the
parties, and the dismissal of the bill upon the ground of acquiescence
amounts to a decision that a right which has once existed
is absolutely and for ever lost."<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> When an infringement has
been shown the Court will not wait until it can ascertain distinctly
what parts have been pirated. It will grant an injunction
in general terms restraining the defendant, his agents, servants,
or workmen from further printing, publishing, selling, or otherwise
disposing of any copy or copies of the defendant's book
containing any passage or passages copied, taken, or colourably
altered from the plaintiff's book.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> If it appears that the piratical
parts of the defendant's book can be distinguished from that
which is innocent, this will be done in the injunction.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> For a
form of injunction against a servant restraining him from using
blocks and materials obtained while in the plaintiff's employment,
see <i>Lamb</i> v. <i>Evans</i>.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> An injunction will be granted
without any inquiry as to actual damages;<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> but there must
be probability of damage. In <i>Borthwick</i> v. <i>Evening Post</i>,<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>
Cotton, L. J., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In my opinion, in order to justify the Court in granting an injunction,
we ought to be satisfied that there probably will be injury to the pockets
of the plaintiff ... an injunction is an equitable remedy, and ought not
to be granted unless the Court is satisfied that there is damage to the
plaintiff&mdash;probable damage, not necessarily damage already suffered&mdash;as
the result of the defendant's conduct."<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Quære</i> whether an injunction will be granted to protect the
future numbers of a periodical. In <i>Cate</i> v. <i>Devon and Exeter
Constitutional Newspaper Company</i>,<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> North, J., in granting an
injunction to restrain a systematic infringement of a periodical,
said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is clear that an injunction can only be granted in respect of
matters in regard to which the plaintiffs now have the copyright and a
present right to sue; they cannot have any protection by injunction to
restrain the defendants from publishing hereafter any future entries with
respect to which the plaintiffs may possibly ... acquire a copyright,
... but as to which they clearly cannot at this moment have any copyright."<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In another case, however, where a single illustration had
been taken from <i>Punch</i>, Kekewich, J., said he saw no objection
to the injunction extending to the protection of the contents of
future numbers of <i>Punch</i>, and granted a perpetual injunction
accordingly against the <i>Ludgate Monthly</i>.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> An injunction will
not be granted when it is difficult or impossible to enforce
it,<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> for instance, when the defendant can readily reprint the
same matter, compiling it from original sources.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> The piracy
proved may be so inconsiderable, and so little likely to
injure the plaintiff, that the Court may decline to interfere by
injunction.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p><b>Delivery up of Copies.</b>&mdash;All copies of any books wherein
there is copyright and of which entry has been made in the
Registry Book and which are unlawfully printed or imported, are
deemed to be the property of the registered proprietor of such
copyright, and he is entitled after demand in writing to sue for
the same in detinue and trover.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>This right to the delivery up of pirated copies for the
benefit of the proprietor of the copyright is purely statutory.
Under the Acts of Anne and George III. the proprietor on
delivery up was enjoined to damask and make waste paper of the
copies.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> Under the Act of Victoria the proprietor for the first
time is entitled to recover such copies for his own use. It has
been doubted whether there was any right to delivery up at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
common law,<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> but the bulk of authority is in favour of the view
that there was,<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> although the delivery up was for destruction
only.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> It is a doubtful point whether section 23 applies to unlawful
copies made before registration of the plaintiff's title.
Fry, L. J., held that it did not,<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> and therefore in the case of such
copies ordered delivery up for destruction as a common law
remedy, but refused the statutory remedy of delivery up for
the plaintiff's benefit. Jessel, M. R., however, differed from this
view,<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> and thought that the 23rd section applied to unlawful
copies made before the plaintiff's title was registered. It must
also be considered doubtful whether section 23 applies where
the defendant's book is not merely a reprint of the plaintiff's. In
an Irish case O'Brien, J., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It would be difficult to maintain that under the 23rd section the
proprietor of the copyright in a book would acquire the property of all
copies of another book which contained printed therein a few pages or
passages of his book."<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But, whether or not in such a case the plaintiff would be
entitled under the section to extraction and delivery up for his
benefit of the pirated parts, he is under the general jurisdiction
of the Court entitled to delivery up for cancellation.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> In
<i>Warne</i> v. <i>Seebohm</i><a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> the order was that the defendant should
first state upon oath what copies of the work exist; secondly,
extract from those copies which are in his possession or power
and deliver up to the plaintiffs for cancellation all passages copied,
taken, or colourably imitated from the plaintiffs' book; thirdly,
produce to the plaintiffs, if required by them for examination,
the copies after the pirated passages have been extracted.<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>
<i>Quære</i> whether the Court would order delivery up in an action
to which the person who owned the books and paper and at
whose expense the printing was executed was not a party.<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span></p>

<p><b>Customs Act.</b>&mdash;The Customs Laws Consolidation Act, 1876,<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
provides for the seizure of foreign books, and in this respect
is somewhat inconsistent with section 17 of the Copyright Act.
Section 42 of the Customs Act prohibits the importation of books
"first composed or written or printed in the United Kingdom
and printed or reprinted in any other country, as to which the
proprietor of such copyright or his agent shall have given to the
Commissioners of Customs a notice in writing duly declared<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
that such copyright subsists, such notice also stating when such
copyright will expire." On reference to section 17 of the Copyright
Act it will be noticed that the prohibition there is as to
books "reprinted in any country or place outside the British
dominions." <i>Quære</i> does the provision in the Customs Act
enlarge the protection by the words "printed or reprinted in
any other country"? Does this include the colonies? Again it
will be noticed that the Copyright Act has no condition as to notice
to the Commissioners of Customs. <i>Quære</i> is the notice required
by the Customs Act a condition precedent to all protection from
unlawful importation, and in this respect does the Customs Act
limit the provisions of the Copyright Act, or is the Customs Act
merely directory to the Custom-house officials? To be on the safe
side the notice should always be given. Section 44 of the Customs
Act provides for the keeping of a list of books as to which
notice has been given, and section 45 entitles any person who
shall have cause to complain of the insertion of any book in
such list to apply to a judge at chambers for the rectification
thereof.</p>

<p><b>Every Offence.</b>&mdash;Each separate transaction of sale or importation
will constitute a separate offence, for which a
separate penalty of £10 will accrue.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> It would seem that
"every such offence" does not, as in the Artistic Copyright
Act, mean "or the sale or importation of every copy."<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

<p><b>Limitation of Action.</b>&mdash;Section 26 of the Copyright Act, 1842,
enacts, "that all actions, suits, bills, indictments or informations
for any offence that shall be committed against this Act shall be
brought, sued, and commenced within twelve calendar months
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
next after such offence committed, or else the same shall be void
and of none effect." It is clear that even although the remedy
for one offence is barred, that in no way extinguishes the owner's
right, and the owner may sue for subsequent offences;<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> thus
although a piratical book has been printed and published more
than twelve months before action brought, yet the owner will
be entitled to sue in respect of sales, &amp;c., made within the
twelve months. In a Scotch case, <i>Stewart</i> v. <i>Black</i>,<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> it seems to
have been held by Lord President Boyle that the limitation in the
26th section did not apply to an action of damages for infringement,
and Malins, V. C., says <i>obiter</i> in <i>Weldon</i> v. <i>Dicks</i>,<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> that in his
opinion the limitation only applies to an action for penalties. It
is submitted that <i>Stewart</i> v. <i>Black</i>, if applied to books published
after 1842, is wrong, and that the dictum of Malins, V. C., in
<i>Weldon</i> v. <i>Dicks</i>, is also wrong. The section seems sufficiently
clear and applicable to all actions brought in respect of an
infringement of copyright. The argument contra seems to be
based on the use of the words "for any offence that shall be
committed," from which it is argued, that penalties only are
pointed at. Offence, however, is used in the 15th section as
applicable to infringement of copyright not involving penalties.
In cases where the Public Authorities Protection Act applies, the
shorter limitation of six months must be substituted.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

<p><b>Pleading.</b>&mdash;The defendant is required to give to the plaintiff
a notice in writing of any objections on which he means to rely
on the trial of the action. If the defendant intends to dispute
that the plaintiff is author or first publisher, or that he is proprietor,
he must state the name of the person whom he alleges
to be the author or proprietor, together with the title of the
book and the time when, and the place where, such book was
first published.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> It has been said to be sufficient, in the case of
an old publication, to state the year of first publication without
stating the day and month in the notice of objections.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span></p>

<p>The notice of objections must be specific, and give full notice
of the nature of the defence.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> If the defence is that the book
has not been registered at all, that must be stated.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> If a faulty
registration is relied on, it is not sufficient to deny that the book
has been duly registered; the notice must state what the particular
objection to the registration is.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> If the plaintiff's title is
denied, it will not do merely to state that the proprietor "is some
person unknown, but not the plaintiff;"<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> the full particulars as
required by the section must be given.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> In objecting to the
registration, however, it is not necessary for the defendant to
state what the correct entry should he. Thus if he says the time
of first publication is wrongly entered, he does not require to
specify the true date of first publication.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> It is unnecessary to
deliver a separate "Notice of Objections," as was the practice at
one time,<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> it is sufficient if it is incorporated in the defence.
A suggestion of defective title contained in an affidavit would
not be sufficient.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> If a defective title is apparent from the
plaintiff's own statement of claim or evidence, the action would
probably be dismissed by the Court, <i>proprio motu</i>, even although
the defendant had not given notice of objection.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> Leave to
amend the pleadings and take further objection may be allowed
on conditions under the judicial discretion given by the Rules
of the Supreme Court,<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> but if the objection be merely technical,
the Court will not give leave to amend,<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> unless, perhaps, the
plaintiff had otherwise fair notice that the objection might be
taken.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> It has been held by a County Court judge that section
16 of the Copyright Act does not apply to proceedings in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
County Court, as that Court was created after the date of the
Act.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

<p>The plaintiff may be ordered to specify the particular
passages which he is prepared to prove have been pirated
from his work.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p><b>Evidence.</b>&mdash;The great test of piracy is coincidence of blunders,
and when some passages are proved by the recurrence of blunders
to have been copied, other passages which are the same with
passages in the original book are presumed <i>primâ facie</i> to be
likewise copied, although no blunders occur in them.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p>It will greatly prejudice the defendant if his manuscript is
not produced or accounted for.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>A denial by the defendant that he has made any use whatsoever
of the plaintiff's work raises a presumption of piracy if it is shown
that he must have made some use of it, however fair.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>To prove that A on a certain date heard certain music performed
from printed sheets, is no evidence that the music was
published as a book at that date.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p><b>Discovery.</b>&mdash;The defendant is entitled to administer interrogatories
to ascertain the extent of the sale of plaintiff's book,
and to enable the defendant to ascertain the damages and pay
into Court.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>The plaintiff is entitled to interrogate as to the original sources
from which the defendant alleges his work to have been compiled.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p><b>Mode of Trial.</b>&mdash;Formerly the question of piracy or no
piracy and the amount of damages was frequently tried by jury,
but now the trial of the action is almost invariably before a
judge alone, either in the Chancery or the King's Bench Division.
Either party may ask for a trial by jury, but not as a matter
of right, it is a matter entirely in the discretion of the
Court and semble that the onus lies on the party applying
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
for a jury to show that the cause could be more conveniently
tried in that way.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p><b>Costs.</b>&mdash;In copyright as in other actions a successful party
may be refused his costs. The plaintiff will not get his costs if
he has unduly acquiesced in the defendant's conduct, and thereby
induced the defendant to incur expenses,<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> or if after acquiescence
and delay an action is brought without fair warning.<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> So, too,
if the plaintiff has suffered no real harm, but brings an action for
the purpose of making money out of it;<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> and in one case where
the Court was of opinion that although the plaintiff was entitled
to nominal damages, the action was one which should never
have been brought, the plaintiff was ordered to pay the defendant's
costs as well as his own.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> If the plaintiff has increased the
expenses by raising other questions in which he has failed, the
costs will be apportioned.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> A defendant, although successful,
may lose his costs or part of them if he has acted in such a way
as was not fair and right as between man and man;<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> for instance,
if he has made some use of the plaintiff's book, but does not
acknowledge it at the hearing.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> A successful defendant may
lose his costs if in his defence he challenges the plaintiff's title
and fails in his attack, but wins on the question of piracy. If a
defendant by his conduct in lending his name to a publication
has led the plaintiff to assume that he "caused it to be printed,"
he will probably not be allowed his costs.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> A defendant may
also be refused his costs if the Court is of opinion that he
brought the action on himself by sailing too near the wind.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>
The Court will not encourage a plagiarist or one who has made
an illiberal use of another's work, even although he has not
actually committed a piracy. Costs have also been refused
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
where, although the defendant succeeded, his defence was a
merely technical one, such as a defect in registration.<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> If copyright
is claimed in part of a book only, the whole of which is
registered without distinction, the notice of motion or statement
of claim should specify the parts in which copyright is claimed,
or the plaintiff may be liable in costs unnecessarily incurred by
the defendant.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section II.&mdash;What is a Piratical Copy.</span></h3>

<p>Literary property may be invaded in three ways:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">(i.)</span> Open Piracy;</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">(ii.)</span> Literary Larceny;</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">(iii.)</span> Commercial Fraud.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>With the first there is no difficulty once a title has been
established and the pirate caught. It consists in a bodily
reprinting and publishing of the whole or of large portions of
a copyright book. The third is not properly speaking an infringement
of copyright. It is the invasion of the common law
rights of an author or publisher, and will be dealt with later.
The second, literary larceny, gives rise to many difficult
questions and is dealt with in this section.</p>

<p>The question put by the law is, in its simplest form: "Is the
alleged infringement an unauthorised copy of the whole or part
of a copyright work?" The statute does not attempt to define
what a copy is, and such rules as there are for determining
whether one work is a copy of another are entirely derived from
the case law on the subject. It is impossible to lay down any
very definite rules as to infringement; it is really a question
of fact not of law; and although now almost invariably tried by
a judge sitting alone, it was at one time constantly referred to
the decision of a jury. The judges either in giving their own
decisions or in directing juries have from time to time laid down
general rules as an aid to determining these questions of fact.</p>

<p>The Copyright Acts have always received a liberal interpretation
in favour of the author, and against the plagiarist. "If we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
can construe the Act so as to promote fair and honest dealing,
such a construction is to be preferred."<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p><b>What is a Copy.</b>&mdash;A copy is that which will provide a substitute
for the whole or for a substantial part of the original book.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>
The owner of the copyright has the sole and exclusive liberty
of printing or otherwise multiplying copies. It has been held
that the right is not in any way limited by section 15 of the Copyright
Act, 1842, which section applies its remedy only to cases
where the subject-matter is multiplied by printing.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> Thus copies
produced by writing,<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> lithography,<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> type writing,<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> photography,<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> are
copies within the meaning of the Act. The symbols used matter
little in themselves; the question in each case is whether the
defendants are multiplying copies.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> It is not necessary that the
copy should be primarily intended to be used for the same
purpose as the original. Thus a copy in shorthand characters
intended for instruction in shorthand was held to be an infringement
of a story in a magazine.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> But the copy must provide
a reasonable substitute for the whole or part of the original
work. A perforated scroll used for the mechanical reproduction
of music from an instrument is not a copy, since no reasonable
being would use it as a substitute for the original sheet of music.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p><b>A Substantial Part must be Taken.</b>&mdash;In other words, <i>De
minimis non curat lex</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Part is not necessarily the same as particle, and there may be a
taking so minute in its extent and so trifling in its nature as not to incur
the statutable liability."<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Sweet</i> v. <i>Benning</i>,<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> Jervis, C. J., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is undoubtedly exceedingly difficult, perhaps absolutely impossible,
to lay down any general rule upon this subject. I do not assent to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
the argument that every publication of a portion of a work in which there
is subsisting copyright will afford a ground of action: it is a question of
degree which must depend upon the circumstances of each particular
case."</p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Chatterton</i> v. <i>Cave</i>,<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> Brett, J., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Unless there is a taking of a material and substantial part there is
no infringement of copyright. It is true that the question under the
second section is not only whether the whole production has been copied,
but also whether a part has been copied; but by a part this section must
mean a material and substantial part."<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Chatterton</i> v. <i>Cave</i>,<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> two small points or incidents were
taken from one drama by the author of another, and it was
held that the taking was not of a substantial part. In <i>Pike</i> v.
<i>Nicholas</i>,<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> in the case of two rival essays on the same subject,
one quotation from a classical author was taken by the defendant
directly from the plaintiff's book; Lord Hatherley, L. C., and
Giffard, L. J., were of opinion that it would not do to show
merely one or two passages; some material part of the book
must be shown to have been taken.</p>

<p>The question is not altogether one of quantity, it is perhaps
mainly one of quality,<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> and depends on the character of the work
and the relative value of the material taken.<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The question of the extent of appropriation which is necessary to
establish an infringement of copyright is often one of extreme difficulty:
but in cases of this description the quality of the piracy is more important
than the proportion which the borrowed passages bear to the whole
work."<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p>"It ought to be clearly established that, looking at the works as a
whole, there has been a substantial appropriation by the one party of the
independent labour of the other before any proceeding on the ground of
copyright can be justified."<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>

<p>"When it comes to a question of quantity it must be very vague.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
One writer might take all the vital<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> part of another's book, though it
might be but a small proportion of the book in quantity. It is not only
quantity, but value that is always looked to."<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>"The principle of the cases is that, when one man for his own profit
puts into his work an essential part of another man's work from which
that other may still derive profit, or from which but for the act of the
first he might have derived profit, there is evidence of piracy."<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Although it is no excuse for infringement to say that the
matter taken has been improved upon or added to, yet there
may be so much new matter that the part borrowed becomes
so insignificant that the Courts will not interfere. In <i>Mawman</i> v.
<i>Tegg</i>,<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> Lord Chancellor Eldon says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"After the quantity of matter which has been copied has been
ascertained, the quantity of matter not piratical with which the piratical
matter has been intermixed is still a circumstance of great importance."</p></blockquote>

<p>The materiality of the part taken may sometimes be judged
more by the proportion which it bears to the defendant's work
than to the work from which it is taken. Thus in <i>Neale</i> v.
<i>Harmer</i><a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> the plaintiff had prepared and published an elaborate
work intituled "The Abbey Church of St. Alban," containing
about 200 architectural drawings. The defendant took and published
three of these in a magazine article on St. Alban's Abbey,
and they were the only strictly architectural drawings illustrating
the article. It was held to be an infringement. Kekewich, J.,
said in his judgment:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is said that these drawings did not form a material part of the
plaintiff's work. In one sense that is true. The plaintiff's work is a
large one, and it is a very learned work. The test is not so much
what proportion of the plaintiff's work had been taken, but rather what
portion of the defendant's work is the plaintiff's."</p></blockquote>

<p>In questions of amount it is material to inquire whether the
matter was taken so as to compete with the plaintiff's work,<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
an infringement need not necessarily be shown to be in competition
with the work infringed, since it is sufficient if the
defendant has made such a use of part of the plaintiff's work as
the plaintiff might himself have done.</p>

<p>If matter is taken regularly and systematically by one periodical
from another, and particularly if it is taken and claimed to
be taken as of right, a very small amount will suffice.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> As to a
claim of right, North, J., said in <i>Cate</i> v. <i>Devon</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That of itself is sufficient to put the plaintiff in the wrong in the
action and get over any question as to the amount of matter actually
taken."<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Although the Court will not grant a remedy for a trifling
infringement, it will not refuse an injunction merely on account
of the minute inquiries into detail which, in some cases, may be
necessary to establish even an extensive piracy.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p><b>No Animus Furandi need be Proved.</b>&mdash;In <i>Cary</i> v. <i>Kearsley</i><a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>
Lord Ellenborough's judgment contained a reference to the
<i>animus furandi</i> in cases of infringement, from which a mistaken
idea seems to have arisen that in all cases of infringement the
<i>animus furandi</i> must be proved.<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> Lord Ellenborough said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That part of the work of one author is found in another is not
in itself piracy or sufficient to support an action; a man may fairly adopt
part of the work of another; he may so make use of another's labours for
the promotion of science and the benefit of the public, but having done
so the question will be, was the matter so taken used fairly with that view
and without what I may term the <i>animus furandi</i>."<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This did not mean that in every case of infringement alleged
it was necessary to prove an <i>animus furandi</i> or guilty intention.
Lord Ellenborough in a subsequent case<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The intention to pirate is not necessary in an action of this sort; it
is enough that the publication complained of is in substance a copy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
whereby a work vested in another is prejudiced. If A takes the property
of B the <i>animus furandi</i> is inferred from the act."<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Scott</i> v. <i>Stanford</i>,<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> Page Wood, V. C., after quoting the
above passage from Lord Ellenborough's judgment in <i>Cary</i> v.
<i>Kearsley</i>,<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is urged that this is a case in which no <i>animus furandi</i> can be
found on the part of Mr. Hunt, who has taken these statistics in perfect
good faith and with the fullest acknowledgment<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> in his book of the
source from which they are derived. But if in effect the great bulk of
the plaintiff's publication&mdash;a large and vital portion of his work and
labour&mdash;has been appropriated and published in a form which will
materially injure his copyright, mere honest intention on the part of the
appropriator will not suffice, as the Court can only look at the result and
not at the intention in the man's mind at the time of doing the act complained
of, and he must be presumed to intend all that the publication of
his work effects."<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Although the <i>animus furandi</i> does not require to be proved,
it is a useful aid to proof, and where it appears piracy is more
readily presumed.<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<p><b>Taking not necessarily for Profit.</b>&mdash;The prohibition in
section 15 of the Copyright Act, 1842, is against printing or
causing to be printed "either for sale or exportation," but as this
has been held not to confine piracy to copying by means of
printing, neither does it confine it to copying for sale or exportation,
and the purpose for which the copy when made is to
be used is immaterial. In <i>Alexander</i> v. <i>Mackenzie</i><a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> the Society of
Writers to the Signet in Edinburgh prepared for the use of their
own members a book of forms taken largely from a similar
copyright work. The Court of Session held that this was an
infringement of copyright. A catalogue of books, although not
intended for sale, may be an infringement of another catalogue;<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
manuscript copies of a copyright song distributed exclusively
among the members of a philharmonic society,<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> and a telegraphic
code distributed only among the agents of a shipping
firm have also been prohibited.<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> In <i>Ager</i> v. <i>The P. &amp; O.</i>, Kay, J.,
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It has long been settled that multiplying copies for private
distribution among a limited class of persons is just as illegal as if it were
done for the purpose of sale."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is submitted that making a single copy for private use is an
infringement.</p>

<p><b>Copying may be Indirect and Unintentional.</b>&mdash;If matter in
which copyright exists is taken it is immaterial that the appropriation
was made not directly from the original work but
indirectly through some other work, copyright or non-copyright,
authorised or unauthorised. Thus a book may be infringed
by retranslating or copying a translation of it,<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> and a drama may
be infringed by dramatizing a novel founded on the drama.<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> In
<i>Cate</i> v. <i>Devon and Exeter Constitutional Newspaper Company</i>,<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> it
was argued that an indirect copying could not be considered an
infringement, because since the copyist is ignorant of what works
he is indirectly copying, he cannot know whether or not he is
infringing any copyright books, but this argument was rejected.
Ignorance on the part of the copyist does not excuse him from
the consequences of his act.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p><b>Custom of Trade</b> has been pleaded in defence of what was
otherwise clearly a piracy. A custom was alleged whereby
provincial newspapers were entitled to make large extracts,
without criticism, from articles in magazines which were sent
to them;<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> and in another case "a usual practice" among
publishers of magazines to take articles from each other<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
pleaded. It is clear that no such customs can be admitted.
In <i>Walter</i> v. <i>Steinkopff</i><a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> the <i>St. James' Gazette</i> alleged that
there was a universal understanding among journalists and
newspaper proprietors that paragraphs of news may be quoted
verbatim by one daily paper from another without express
consent, provided (1) the source was acknowledged, (2) the
papers were not direct rivals, (3) there is give and take between
the papers, and (4) no expressed objection. The <i>St. James'
Gazette</i> took articles from the <i>Times</i> on this alleged footing.
North, J., held that they had not complied with these conditions,
and that even if they had it would have been no defence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The plea of the existence of such a habit or practice of copying, as
is set up, can no more be supported when challenged than the highwayman's
plea of the custom of Hounslow Heath."<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><b>Fair Use.</b>&mdash;When an author writes on a subject in which
there are common sources of information he must do the work
of research and compilation for himself, and the only use he
can lawfully make of a prior copyright work on the same
subject is&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">i.</span> Using the information or the ideas contained in it without
copying its words or imitating them so as to produce
what is substantially a copy.</span>

<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">ii.</span> Making extracts (even if they are not acknowledged as
such) appearing under all the circumstances of the case
reasonable in quality, number, and length, regard being
had to the objects for which the extracts are made and
to the subjects to which they relate.</span>

<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">iii.</span> Using one book on a given subject as a guide to authorities
afterwards independently consulted by the author
of another book on the same subject.</span>

<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">iv.</span> Using one book on a given subject for the purpose of
checking the results independently arrived at by the
author of another book on the same subject.<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>
</span></div></div>

<p><i>No one can monopolize a Field of Labour.</i>&mdash;Although an author
has been the first to deal with a particular subject, his priority
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
gives him no exclusive right therein.<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> Any one else can do
exactly the same as he has done. If a man draws a map of a
newly-discovered island, or writes a book on the habits of its
natives, he acquires no right to prevent any one from competing
with him in the publication of maps and books dealing
with that island.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> His only right is to prevent any one else
from taking matter from his book. In one of the older
cases it was suggested that there was a usage among booksellers&mdash;a
sort of comity among them&mdash;by which if one
preoccupied a certain subject he was considered a sort of
proprietor.<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> In that case Lord Eldon repudiated the idea that
such could be the law, and now no monopoly of the kind
could be suggested.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"All human events are equally open to all who wish to add to or
improve the materials already collected by others making an original
work."<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>No Infringement to take Facts.</i>&mdash;It is no infringement to state
a fact or an opinion which another man has stated for the first
time: but you must not take his mode of expression or his
selection or arrangement of facts which he has thought proper
to state. Thus there is no copyright in a mere piece of news,
for instance, "The Emperor of China is dead." If one newspaper
proprietor received a telegram from abroad to that effect,
another could take the information as published and print it
in his newspaper. But although there is no copyright in news
as such, the smallest taking of a selection or arrangement of news
will be prohibited. In a case in Victoria<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> the defendants had
taken the plaintiff's telegrams, rearranged them, and altered the
expression, and yet they were held to have been guilty of an
infringement.</p>

<p><i>No Infringement to take the General Scheme or Idea of another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Book or the Theories therein.</i>&mdash;Copyright does not extend to ideas
or schemes or systems or methods: it is confined to their expression;
and if their expression is not copied the copyright is
not infringed.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> Thus in <i>Jarrold</i> v. <i>Houlston</i>,<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> Page Wood, V. C.,
said that even although Dr. Brewer's "Guide to Science," which
purported to give popular scientific information under various
headings in the form of question and answer, had been the first
book of the kind, there was nothing to prevent another person
from originating another book in the same general form, provided
he did so from his own resources.<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> In <i>Pike</i> v. <i>Nicholas</i>,
the case of two rival historical essays on "The Origin of the
English Nation," James, V. C., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is no monopoly in the main theory of the plaintiff, or in the
theories and speculations by which he has supported it, nor even in the
use of the published results of his own observations."<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A careful distinction must be drawn between the taking of
a scheme and the taking of it as applied to certain material, <i>i. e.</i>
the taking of the expression. For instance, in <i>Kelly</i> v. <i>Morris</i>,<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>
the plaintiff had adopted a "very ingenious form of arrangement"
in his "Street Directory." The defendant was held to
have infringed the plaintiff's copyright by taking his list of streets
from the plaintiff's work. The only thing he was entitled to do
was to adopt the "ingenious form of arrangement" and apply it
for himself.</p>

<p><i>Every Author must do his own Work.</i>&mdash;In <i>Longman</i> v. <i>Winchester</i>,<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
the action being for the infringement of copyright in a
court calendar, Lord Eldon drew an analogy to the case of a
map describing a particular county and a map of the same
county afterwards published by another person, which, if the
description be accurate in both, must be very much the same,
yet he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is clear the latter publisher cannot on that account be justified in
sparing himself the labour and expense of actual survey."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span></p>

<p>In <i>Lewis</i> v. <i>Fullarton</i>,<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> Lord Langdale, M. R., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Any man is entitled to write and publish a topographical dictionary
and to avail himself of the labours of all former writers whose works are
not subject to copyright, and of all public sources of information: but
whilst all are entitled to resort to common sources of information, none
are entitled to save themselves trouble and expense by availing themselves
for their own profit of other men's works still subject to copyright
and entitled to protection."<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the case of Dr. Brewer's "Guide to Science,"<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> Page
Wood, V. C., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In publishing a work in the form of question and answer on a
variety of scientific subjects the defendant had a right to look to all those
books which were unprotected by copyright, and to make such use of
them as he thought fit by turning them into questions and answers. He
had also a further right if he found a work like Dr. Brewer's, and perusing
it was struck by seeing&mdash;as I think has been the case in the present
instance&mdash;that the author had been led up to particular questions and
answers by the perusal of some other work to have recourse himself to
the same work, although possibly he would not have thought of doing so
but for the perusal of the plaintiff's book.... It would also be a legitimate
use of a work of this description if the author of a subsequent work, after
getting his own work with great pains and labour into a shape approximating
to what he considered a perfect shape, should look through the earlier
work to see whether it contained any heads which he had forgotten."<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Hotten</i> v. <i>Arthur</i><a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> the same judge held that the defendant
had infringed the plaintiff's descriptive catalogue of books for
sale:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The only fair use you can make of the work of another of this kind
is where you take a number of such works, catalogues, dictionaries,
digests, &amp;c., and look over them all, and then compile an original work
of your own founded on the information you have extracted from each
and all of them: but it is of vital importance that such new work shall
have no mere copying, no merely colourable alterations, no blind repetition
of obvious errors."</p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Kelly</i> v. <i>Morris</i>,<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> a directory case, there is another clear
dictum from the same judge:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the case of a dictionary, map, guide-book, or directory, when
there are certain common objects of information which must, if described
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
correctly, be described in the same words, a subsequent compiler is
bound to set about doing for himself that which the first compiler has
done. In case of a road-book he must count the milestones for himself.
In the case of a map of a newly-discovered island he must go through
the whole process of triangulation just as if he had never seen any former
map; and generally he is not entitled to take one word of the information
previously published without independently working out the matter
for himself so as to arrive at the same result from the same common
sources of information, and the only use he can legitimately make of a
previous publication is to verify his own calculations and results when
obtained. So in the present case the defendant could not take a single
line of the plaintiff's directory for the purpose of saving himself labour
and trouble in getting his information.... What he has done has been
just to copy the plaintiff's book and then send out canvassers to see if the
information so copied was correct.... The work of the defendant has
clearly not been compiled by the legitimate application of independent
personal labour."<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Scott</i> v. <i>Stanford</i>,<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> Page Wood, V. C., held that certain
tables of statistical returns in the coal market had been pirated.
In his judgment he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The defendant, after collecting the information for himself, might
have checked his results by the plaintiff's tables, but that is a widely
different thing from this wholesale extraction of the vital part of his work.
No man is entitled to avail himself of the previous labours of another for
the purpose of conveying to the public the same information, although he
may append additional information to that already published."</p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Morris</i> v. <i>Ashbee</i>,<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> Giffard, V. C., held that the copyright in
a business directory had been infringed in so far as the compilation
and arrangement of the advertisements and names of
traders were taken from the plaintiff's directory. In giving
judgment he commented on <i>Kelly</i> v. <i>Morris</i>,<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> pointing out that
the decision in that case was not based solely on the fact that
the information was reprinted bodily by the defendants and then
verified when possible:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The decree is general in its terms, following <i>Lewis</i> v. <i>Fullarton</i>,<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> and
the substance of the judgment is that in a case such as this no one has a
right to take the results of the labour and expense incurred by another
for the purposes of a rival publication, and thereby save himself the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
expense and labour of working out and arriving at these results by some
independent road."</p></blockquote>

<p>In reference to the case before him the Vice-Chancellor
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is plain that it could not be lawful for the defendants simply to
cut the slips which they have cut from the plaintiff's directory and insert
them in theirs. Can it be lawful to do so because in addition to doing
this they sent persons with the slips to ascertain their correctness? I
say, clearly not. Then, again, would their acts be rendered lawful because
they got payment and authority<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> for the insertion of the names from each
individual whose name appeared in the slips? And to this again I
answer, clearly not. They had no right to make the results arrived at by
the plaintiff the foundation of their work or any material part of it, and
this they have done."<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Morris</i> v. <i>Wright</i>,<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> another case of alleged infringement of
the same business directory, Giffard, L. J., distinguished it from
<i>Kelly</i> v. <i>Morris</i><a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> and <i>Morris</i> v. <i>Ashbee</i>,<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> inasmuch as the plaintiff's
work had only been used by the defendant as a guide to
original sources. He held that there was no infringement.
Referring to the passage quoted above from the judgment of
Page Wood, V. C., in <i>Kelly</i> v. <i>Morris</i>,<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This passage does not mean that a subsequent compiler may not
look into the book for the purpose of ascertaining whether it was worth
his while to call upon that person or not, but it means that he may not
take that particular slip and show that to the person and get his authority
as to putting that particular slip in."<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So also quotations from and references to previous authors
must not be taken bodily from a rival work. They may be used
as a guide and as a guide only. Lord Hatherley, L. C., in <i>Pike</i> v.
<i>Nicholas</i>,<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> a case of rival historical works on the same subject,
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Although the defendant might have been led to look more minutely
into <i>Prichard</i> than he otherwise would have done by referring to the
plaintiffs work, still the plaintiff could not say, 'I, having found these
passages in <i>Prichard</i>, will prohibit all the world who may find the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
passages from making use of them.' The moment he had given that
degree of light to the defendant which led him to refer to that common
source, if the defendant did really and <i>bonâ fide</i> look at that common
source, he did all that this Court required him to do. He must not
simply copy the passage from the plaintiffs book, but, having been put
on to the track, and having looked at that particular part of the book
which the plaintiff led him to, he was entitled to make use of every
passage from that author which the plaintiff had made use of."<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In this case the quotation was proved to have been taken
directly from the plaintiff's work, but this was considered to be
so small a taking that the bill was dismissed, though without
costs, the Court being satisfied "that the book of the defendant
was his own composition in this sense, that wherever he got
the materials from they were worked up by him into his own
language."<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<p>It is no excuse for piracy to say that with a little labour the
copyist could have produced identically the same result.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> The
fact that the result may be identical is a reason for not making
a new book, but it is no reason for copying another's book.</p>

<p><i>Work with a Different Object.</i>&mdash;An author is much less restricted
in the use which he may make of a previously published
copyright book if such book is of an entirely different nature or
has a different scope or object from his own work. Considerable
portions may then be taken for the purpose of comment,
criticism, or illustration. Lord Eldon suggested in one case<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> that
a copyright map might be taken bodily for the purpose of insertion
in a book giving an historical account of all the different
maps of a particular district. In <i>Bradbury</i> v. <i>Hotten</i>,<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> Kelly, C. B.,
suggested that a picture might be reproduced amongst a large
collection published for an entirely different object from that
which the first publisher had in view.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We must consider in each case the intent of the copyist and the
nature of the work. A traveller publishes a book of travels about some
distant country like China. Amongst other things he describes some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
mode of preparing food in use there. Then the compiler of a cookery
book republishes the description. No one would say that was a piracy.
So, again, an author publishes a history illustrated with woodcuts of the
heads of kings, and another person writing another history of some
other country finds occasion to copy one of these woodcuts. That again
would not be a piracy."<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>These <i>obiter dicta</i> illustrate sufficiently well the distinction
between taking for a rival work and taking for an entirely
different object; it is probable, however, that some of them go
too far and tend to follow the mistake of the older view of infringement
in looking more to the value of the work done by the
plagiarist than to the value of the material taken. As authoritative
<i>dicta</i> they must, therefore, be accepted with caution. The
best test of infringement or no infringement in a taking of this
kind is to inquire whether the subsequent work by reason of the
taking provides a substitute for the whole or any substantial part
of the prior publication. In <i>Bradbury</i> v. <i>Hotten</i>,<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> nine cartoons,
illustrative of the career of Napoleon III., were published in
<i>Punch</i> in nine several weekly numbers. The defendants
published a volume entitled "Story of the Life of Napoleon, as
told by popular Caricaturists of the last thirty years," which contained
among numerous other illustrations taken from French
and English comic journals the nine cartoons first produced in
<i>Punch</i>. This was held to be an infringement of the copyright in
<i>Punch</i>. In <i>Nicols</i> v. <i>Pitman</i><a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> the defendant published in an
educational work for the purpose of instruction in shorthand
writing a lecture delivered by the plaintiff on "The Dog as the
Friend of Man." The Court held there was an infringement,
because although the lecture was reproduced in shorthand characters,
it might by those who could read shorthand be reasonably
used as a substitute for the lecture printed in ordinary
characters. A compiler of an encyclopædia or similar work
would probably be allowed to quote to a certain extent from
copyright monographs, but this must not be carried to such an
extent as to supersede the original work.<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> Several cases have
been before the Courts on the verbatim copying of law reports
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
in whole or in part into legal treatises of various kinds. The
collection of all the reports on a particular branch of law such
as "Poor Law"<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> or "Registration of Voters,<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> is an infringement
of copyright if they are copied verbatim from previously
published copyright reports. This will be so even although they
are collected from the reports of many different reporters.<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> In
<i>Sweet</i> v. <i>Benning</i>,<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> a digest compiled by taking verbatim the
head notes from copyright law reports and arranging them
under appropriate titles was held to be an illegal publication,
the Court being of opinion that the defendant had been guilty of
an abuse of the fair right of extract, which the law allows for the
purpose of comment, criticism, or illustration. No doubt in
text-books large portions of the head notes, arguments of counsel,
and judgments may be taken verbatim. In an ordinary legal
text-book it would require a very free use of verbatim quotation
to found the necessary argument that the text-book provided
even to the smallest extent a substitute for the original reports.
A more difficult question arises where volumes of leading cases
are published, the cases being reproduced verbatim from the
original reports but with extensive notes and comment. In
<i>Saunders</i> v. <i>Smith</i>,<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> the Court refused to decide whether "Smith's
Leading Cases" constituted an infringement of the original
reports, judgment going for the defendants on the ground of
acquiescence. In the Irish case of <i>Hodges</i> v. <i>Welsh</i><a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> a similar
problem was suggested but not decided. The better view
probably is that such a wholesale taking is an infringement of
the copyright of the original reporters.</p>

<p><i>Extract for Purpose of Criticism.</i>&mdash;Lord Eldon, in <i>Mawman</i> v.
<i>Tegg</i>,<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Quotation is necessary for the purpose of reviewing, and quotation
for such a purpose is not to have the appellation of piracy affixed to it;
but quotation may be carried to the extent of manifesting piratical
intention."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span></p>

<p>Considerable quotation may be made for the <i>bonâ fide</i> purpose
of criticising a copyright book;<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> in one case<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> nearly a quarter of
a controversial article in a magazine was quoted in a reply
thereto published in another magazine, and the Court held that
this constituted no infringement, as the extracts were clearly
inserted for the purpose of criticism and argument. The question
is whether so much of the original work is extracted that the
review substantially communicates the same knowledge as the
book reviewed.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> Thus in <i>Campbell</i> v. <i>Scott</i>,<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> the defendant published
"The Book of Poets" containing, <i>inter alia</i>, an essay and
biographical notice of the poet Campbell, and, as the defendant
said, by way of illustrating the poet's works, a large number of
his poems and extracts therefrom were appended to the biographical
notice without any particular observations in the way
of notes to individual pieces or extracts. This was clearly an
infringement of the poet's copyright. In a similar case, <i>Smith</i> v.
<i>Chatto</i>,<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> the defendants published a book entitled "Thackerayana."
It purported to be a critical essay on the life and works
of Thackeray, and contained extensive quotations from his writings,
prefaced and interspersed with comments by the writer of
the book. Hall, V. C., held in fact that the defendants had
inserted the extracts for the purpose of increasing and enhancing
the value of their book, and that they had therefore infringed the
copyright in Thackeray's works.</p>

<p><i>Improvement or Addition of New Matter no Excuse.</i>&mdash;In the
earlier cases of taking material from a rival publication if it was
shown to have been greatly improved and added to, this was
accepted as an excuse for the piracy, on the ground that a new
and more useful work had been given to the public. Thus in
<i>Sayre</i> v. <i>Moore</i><a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> Lord Mansfield said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If an erroneous chart be made, God forbid it should not be corrected
even in a small degree if it thereby become more serviceable and useful
for the purposes to which it is applied."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>

<p>In <i>Cary</i> v. <i>Kearsley</i>,<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> Lord Ellenborough said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"While I shall think myself bound to secure every man in the enjoyment
of his copyright, one must not put manacles on science."</p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Martin</i> v. <i>Wright</i>,<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> Shadwell, V. C., says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Any person may copy and publish the whole of a literary composition
provided he writes notes upon it so as to present it to the public
connected with matter of his own."</p></blockquote>

<p>The theory of these early cases on infringement seems to
have been&mdash;colourable alteration is not to be allowed, but no
check must be put on the taking of material when it is taken <i>bonâ
fide</i> in the interests of scientific or literary knowledge. Gradually,
however, the Courts in questions of infringement came to look
more to the interests of the author than to those of the public,
and regarded the law of copyright more as a means of securing
rights of property to the individual than as an unnatural monopoly
created for the purpose of encouraging and developing
literary effort. Thus in <i>D'Almaine</i> v. <i>Boosey</i>,<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> in 1835, it was held
to be an infringement to publish the music of an opera in the
form of waltzes and quadrilles, and this notwithstanding that
these waltzes and quadrilles would, if taken from the music of a
non-copyright opera, have been protected as original works.<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>
Since then many cases have followed on the same lines, and no
addition, correction, or improvement will now be accepted as an
excuse for taking a material part of a copyright publication.<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>
But although improvement and addition is no excuse for taking
a substantial portion of another author's work, the fact that there
has been such improvement and addition is not to be entirely
ignored in questions of infringement. It may be an important
factor in determining whether or not there has been a taking of
a substantial part.<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> We have seen that to determine that question
the two works must be taken as a whole and their relation to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
one another considered, and particularly the relative value of the
material taken.<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></p>

<p><i>Dramatization of a Novel.</i>&mdash;The representation on the stage of
a dramatized version of a copyright novel is not in itself an
infringement of copyright in such novel, since copyright only
prohibits the reproduction of copies, and representation on
the stage does not necessarily imply that a copy of the whole
or any material part of the novel has been made.<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> But if in
dramatizing any substantial passages are taken from the novel,
it is an infringement of copyright to print and publish the
drama,<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> and in <i>Warne</i> v. <i>Seebohm</i><a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> Stirling, J., held that the
making of four manuscript or typewritten copies of a drama
taken from a copyright novel&mdash;one for the Lord Chamberlain
and the other three for use in representation&mdash;constituted an
infringement of the copyright in the novel. In this case, as
in <i>Tinsley</i> v. <i>Lacy</i>,<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> considerable passages in the play had been
extracted verbatim from the novel.</p>

<p>Whether if no actual sentences be taken it is an infringement
of copyright to take the characters, the sequence of events, and
scenes, in short, the plot, is doubtful. In <i>Warne</i> v. <i>Seebohm</i> it
was suggested by Stirling, J., in his judgment, that a novel might
be lawfully dramatized if a few copies of the novel were purchased
and a drama compiled therefrom by cutting out and
pasting in the passages which it was thought desirable to take.
This, however, would involve a copying of the arrangement
of scenes and events, and it is suggested that even that might
be an infringement.</p>

<p><i>Abridgments.</i>&mdash;Probably an abridgment in the ordinary sense
of the word, that is, the reproduction of a book in a shorter
form, retaining the general scheme and arrangement, and the
sequence of ideas, would now be held to be an infringement.<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>
In the earlier cases, which tend to excuse a taking by reason
of the utility of additional work bestowed upon the material
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
taken, an abridgment is recognised as a lawful use of a copyright
book. In 1740 Lord Hardwicke, L. C., in dealing with an
alleged abridgment of Sir Matthew Hale's <i>Historia Placitorum
Coronæ</i>,<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Where books are colourably shortened only they are undoubtedly
within the meaning of the Act of Parliament, and are a mere evasion of
the statute and cannot be called an abridgment. But this must not
be carried so far as to restrain persons from making a real and fair
abridgment, for abridgments may with great propriety be called a
new book, because not only the paper and print but the invention,
judgment, and learning of the author is shown in them, and in many cases
are extremely useful though in some instances prejudicial by mistaking
and curtailing the sense of an author."</p></blockquote>

<p>It will be noticed how completely this argument is founded
on the idea that an author may take the materials of another so
long as he sufficiently modifies it by such addition, extraction,
or correction as to give it the character of a new work. It is a
good argument in favour of a plaintiff who has dealt with a
non-copyright work and desires protection, but it would not
now be considered a sound answer to a charge of infringement.
Since <i>Gyles</i> v. <i>Wilcox</i><a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> it seems to have been accepted as law
that what was called a fair abridgment would be allowed.<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> In
<i>Dodsley</i> v. <i>Kinnersley</i><a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> the Court went so far as to admit as a fair
abridgment a magazine article containing about one-tenth of
Dr. Johnson's "Prince of Abyssinia." Selections were, it
appears, taken and reproduced verbatim. The same doctrine
as to abridgments was repeated in <i>D'Almaine</i> v. <i>Boosey</i>:<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is a nice question what shall be deemed such a modification of an
original work as shall absorb the merit of the original in the new
composition. No doubt such a modification may be allowed in some
cases, as in that of an abridgment or digest. Such publications are
in their nature original. Their compiler intends to make of them a new
use, not that which the author proposed to make. Digests are of great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
use to practical men, though not so, comparatively speaking, to students.
The same may be said of an abridgment of any study, but it must be a
<i>bonâ fide</i> abridgment, because if it contains many chapters of the original
work or such as made that work most saleable, the maker of the
abridgment commits a piracy."<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>When the view as to plagiarism being excusable on account of
its utility began to alter, and the Courts began to look more
to what was taken and the value of it than to what labour was
expended on it afterwards, the view taken of abridgments
began to change too. In 1844 one of Dickens' Christmas stories
was abridged evidently much in the same way as Dr. Johnson's
tale in <i>Dodsley</i> v. <i>Kinnersley</i>.<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> Knight Bruce, V. C., held that
there was an infringement:<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The defendant has printed and published a novel, of which fable,
persons, names, and characters of persons, the age, time, country, and
scene are exactly the same, the style of language in which the story is
told is in many instances identical, in all similar, except where certain
alterations by way of extension or substitution have been made, as to
which whether they improve or do not improve upon the original
composition it is not necessary for me to express any opinion. Now
this has been said to be an abridgment, and as an abridgment to be
protected. I am not aware that one man has the right to abridge the
works of another. On the other hand, I do not mean to say that there
may not be an abridgment which may be lawful, which may be protected;
but to say that one man has the right to abridge and so publish in an
abridged form the work of another without more is going much beyond
my notion of what the law of this country is."</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1864 Lord Hatherley, then Sir William Page Wood,
said:<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Court has gone far enough in the direction of sanctioning fair
abridgments; and it is difficult to acquiesce in the reason sometimes
given that the compiler of an abridgment is a benefactor to mankind by
assisting in the diffusion of knowledge."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Translations</i>.&mdash;There are two recent decisions in India to the
effect that the translation of an English book into an Indian
language is not an infringement of the author's copyright.<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
we are to be guided by the general principles of the law of
copyright now accepted by our Courts, I think these Indian
decisions must be held to be wrong. A translation takes everything
in a book but the actual words; it takes the selection of
material and its arrangement, and is certainly a very material
taking of the work and labours of another. The translator is
making a profit from the author's work by using it in a manner
in which the author might have himself used it and made a
similar profit. The only real answer which the translator has
is that he has expended a great deal of skilled labour in putting
the author's book into another form. This might have been a
defence fifty years ago, but I do not think it is a good defence
now. In England there is no direct decision; although there
are several <i>obiter dicta</i> to the effect that a translation is not an
infringement. In <i>Burnett</i> v. <i>Chetwood</i>,<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> in 1720, there is a <i>dictum</i>
of Lord Chancellor Macclesfield, in which he expressed his
opinion that a translation might not be within the prohibition of
the Act (8 Anne c. 19), "on account that the translator had
bestowed his pains upon it." In <i>Millar</i> v. <i>Taylor</i>,<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> Yates, J.,
and in <i>Prince Albert</i> v. <i>Strange</i>,<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> Knight Bruce, V. C., suggest
that a translation is not an infringement. In <i>Wyatt</i> v. <i>Barnard</i><a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>
it was held that a translation would be protected as a new
work, but it does not follow that it is not an infringement of
an old one. I think that these English <i>dicta</i> are practically
useless as authorities, since it cannot now be maintained that
the translator will be permitted to take the work of an original
author merely because he "bestows his pains upon it." In
<i>Murray</i> v. <i>Bogue</i>,<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> Kindersley, V. C., said that if an English book
were translated into a foreign language and then retranslated
into English without authority such translation would be an
infringement of the original work. If this is so, it is difficult
to see why the translation into the foreign language is not also
an infringement if done without authority. The translation
and the retranslation appear to be exactly on the same footing,
both take the substance of the book, the plot, the arrangement,
the selection of material; neither takes the author's words. If it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
is said that one competes with the original which the other does
not, the answer is that it is no defence to say that an infringement
is made for a wholly different market from that which
the original commands.<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> An author is entitled not only to the
uses which he does make of his work, but also to the uses which
he might make of it.</p>

<p><b>Licence</b>.&mdash;A licence in writing<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> granted by the plaintiff to the
defendant is a good defence to an action for infringement. The
licence need not be written or signed by the proprietor himself.
It may be granted by an agent having authority.<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> It would seem
that a licence might be valid without being signed by any one.
The onus of proving a written licence lies upon the defendant in
an action. An assignee of the copyright is not bound by the
licence granted by his assignor, unless at the date of assignment
he has notice of the licence.<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> A licence, unlike an assignment,
may be given before the copyright has come into existence, or
even before the work is composed.<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> A licence from the Dramatic
Authors' Society was held to include the dramas composed by the
members of the society after the date of the licence.<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<p>If an oral licensor were to sue in respect of acts done by
the defendant under his oral licence, the plaintiff's conduct
would probably be considered fraudulent, with the result that
he would be refused an injunction, get nominal damages, and
have to pay the defendant's costs.<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></p>

<p>It need hardly be said that when the use for which a book is
published and sold includes a copying of the whole or part of it,
such copying is not an infringement, even although no express
consent in writing is obtained from the author, for instance, in
the case of copy-books, school maps, precedents of conveyancing.
This, however, does not entitle any one who uses
the book to make a larger use of it in the way of multiplying
copies than that which must be presumed from the nature of
the publication.<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
</p>

<p>It has been suggested that a foreigner resident abroad, who
had obtained a copyright in the United Kingdom, could grant
an oral licence, if by the law of copyright in his own country an
oral licence would be valid.<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> I do not think this is sound.</p>

<p><b>Abandonment</b>.&mdash;Copyright may be abandoned by giving a
general licence to print. Probably, however, this could only be
done by some declaration in writing.<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> The Common Law right
in an unpublished manuscript might be abandoned by leaving it
for a long time in the hands of others.<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> Copyright would not be
lost or abandoned by the fact of a book, during the life of the
author, being allowed to remain out of print.<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>
</p>

<p><b>Acquiescence and Delay</b>.&mdash;This is no ground of defence,
unless in the view of the Court it would make it a fraud afterwards
to insist on the legal right. It would seem that the
defendant must show some act on the part of the plaintiff
inducing the defendant to infringe or continue an infringement
of the copyright.<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> At the best, the defence is only an equitable
one, and will avail no more than to prevent the plaintiff from
getting an injunction or substantial damages, and as the costs
are always in the discretion of the Court, he might be ordered
to pay the defendant's costs.</p>

<p><b>Provision against the Suppression of Books</b>.&mdash;After the death
of an author, if the proprietor of his published work refuses to
republish it, and the book is thereby withheld from the public,
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council may, on complaint,
grant a licence to the complainant to publish such book on such
conditions as they may think fit.<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> There is no record of any
attempt to put in force the provisions of this section.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

PERFORMING RIGHTS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section I.&mdash;Nature of Performing Right.</span></h3>

<p>As copyright is the exclusive right of making copies of a book,
so performing right is the exclusive right of representing or performing
in public dramatic or musical works. In a dramatic or
musical work, the two rights&mdash;the copyright and the performing
right&mdash;exist side by side; but they are quite distinct from one
another, and may pass into different hands. The copyright can
only be infringed by copying, the performing right by representation
or performance. It is no infringement to dramatize and
represent on the stage a copyright novel, since the only exclusive
right as to non-dramatic work is the multiplication of copies;<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>
but a drama on which a novel has been founded may be infringed
by another drama taken from the novel.<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> A writes and publishes
a novel. He then dramatizes it, but does not publish the drama.
B represents a drama founded on the novel. Such a representation
is no infringement either of A's drama<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> or of his novel. It
makes no difference even if A has published his drama.<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> In
dramatizing a copyright novel, however, the making of a single
copy of the drama may be an infringement of the copyright in
the novel.<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> It is no infringement of performing right to print
and publish as a book a play which has been publicly performed,<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>
but it may be an infringement of the common law right in the
MS.,<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> or the statutory copyright in the book if already printed
and published, or it may be a breach of implied contract.<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> If a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
dramatic piece or musical composition is first published as a
book, this does not take away the performing right. This was
decided in <i>Chappell</i> v. <i>Boosey</i><a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> in respect of music, and is equally
applicable to dramatic work. Conversely the representation or
performance of a dramatic piece or musical composition in
public does not deprive the author of his common law right to
publish as a book, or of his copyright when he so publishes.<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>
Performing right extends throughout the British dominions.<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section II.&mdash;Performing Right at Common Law</span>.</h3>

<p>It is doubtful whether there ever was any performing right at
common law. The only case from which it could be gathered
that there was is <i>Morris</i> v. <i>Kelly</i>,<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> where an injunction was
granted by Lord Eldon restraining the performance of a comedy.
The play was apparently in manuscript, but it does not appear
whether it had been performed or not. The ground of the
decision is very uncertain. From the fact that the Lord Chancellor
asked for proof that the assignment was in writing, it
might almost appear that protection was given under the statute
of Anne, which would certainly have been unsound. The
decision may also have been on the ground of common law right
in unpublished manuscript, <i>i. e.</i> the right to prevent any one but
the owner from interfering with it in any way, or it may have
been on the ground of breach of implied contract. Altogether
the decision is unsatisfactory; the application seems to have been
<i>ex parte</i>, and the law hardly to have been considered, so that it
is impossible to base any definite proposition of law on the case.
On the other hand Erie, C. J., stated in the course of the argument
in <i>Marsh</i> v. <i>Conquest</i>,<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> that there was no performing right at
common law. For his authority, however, he cites <i>Murray</i> v.
<i>Elliston</i>,<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> which is hardly sufficient to support the proposition.
In <i>Murray</i> v. <i>Elliston</i> a tragedy by Lord Byron was printed and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
published for sale. The defendants abridged it and represented
it on the stage in the abridged form. It was argued for the
defendant that the tragedy having been printed and published
as a book, must depend for protection entirely on the statute of
Anne in accordance with the decision in <i>Donaldson</i> v. <i>Beckett</i>.<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>
The statute of Anne gave no performing right, and therefore
there was no protection. The Court gave judgment for the
defendant, but the ground of their judgment is not quite clear.
Some stress seems to be laid on the fact that the tragedy was
abridged, and it is therefore left doubtful whether the judges
would have considered the representation of an unabridged
version to be an infringement of the plaintiff's rights. In either
view it is not a decision that there was no performing right at
common law. Another case which may be relied on for the
contention against performing right at common law is <i>Coleman</i>
v. <i>Wathen</i>,<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> but on examination it will be seen that all that case
decides is that the statute of Anne gave no performing right, and
that representation on the stage was not an infringement of
copyright.</p>

<p>It is submitted that the history of the law of performing right
is this: At common law there was no performing right in the
proper sense of the term, but an unpublished manuscript was
protected from performance as from any other invasion of the
author's exclusive right to it. If it was performed on the stage
without being published as a book, there would be a remedy on
breach of implied contract, the public only being admitted for
the purpose of hearing the performance. Once, however, it was
published as a book, all exclusive right of performance was gone.
The statute of Anne gave no performing right, and performing
right proper was first created by 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15. This
statute and 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45 govern the performing right in
dramatic pieces. The performing right in musical compositions
is governed by these two Acts, as modified by the Copyright
(Musical Compositions) Acts of 1882 and 1888.

<h3><span class="smcap">Section III.&mdash;What is a Dramatic Work.</span></h3>

<p>The subject of dramatic performing right must be&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. An original composition.</span>
<span class="i0">2. Of a dramatic nature.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The amount of original composition required is probably the
same as in a literary work claiming the protection of the Copyright
Act, 1842, as a "book." As has been seen the standard is
extremely low, no literary merit or great skill being essential.<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>
Adaptations, translations, and the like, are protected <i>quoad</i> their
transformation.<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></p>

<p>As to what amount of dramatic element is required is not
clear from the statutes, and not much clearer from the decisions.
It is now well decided that in order to secure a performing right
there must be some dramatic element. That is to say, one
cannot compose a non-dramatic work, and after publishing it in
its non-dramatic form, claim the exclusive right to represent the
non-dramatic work on the stage in dramatic form.<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> But the
difficulty is to define what is "dramatic form." The dramatic
works protected by 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15 are "any tragedy,
comedy, play, opera, farce, or any other dramatic piece or entertainment."
In 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45 "dramatic piece" is defined
as including every tragedy, comedy, play, opera, farce, or other
scenic, musical, or dramatic entertainment. Neither definition is
very satisfactory. In <i>Lee</i> v. <i>Simpson</i><a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> it was held that an introduction
to a pantomime, being the only written part, and
intended to be followed by "comic business," was a dramatic
piece. This case as reported, however, is of little assistance, as
it does not show what the exact nature of the "introduction"
was, and the judgment of the Court does not contain any definition
of a dramatic piece. In <i>Russell</i> v. <i>Smith</i><a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> the question was
more carefully considered. The work in which a performing
right was claimed was a song called "The Ship on Fire." It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
was founded on the loss of <i>The Kent</i> by fire in the Bay of Biscay.
According to the judgment&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It represents a storm at sea, the burning of the ship, and an escape
by boat to another ship, and so a safe return to land. It moves terror
and pity and sympathy, by presenting danger, and despair, and joy, and
maternal and conjugal affection. A witness of great experience in publishing
music deposed that this was considered a dramatic song."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Court held that it was a "dramatic piece." Lord
Denman, C. J., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The nature of the production places it rather in the representative
than the narrative class of poetry, according to Lord Bacon's division of
dramatic from epic; and the evidence states it to be known as dramatic
among those who are conversant with such things. The interpretative
clause of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45, sec. 2, declares that 'dramatic piece' within
the Act includes 'tragedy, comedy, play, opera, farce, or any other scenic,
musical, or dramatic entertainment.' These words comprehend any piece
which could be called dramatic in its widest sense, any piece which on
its being presented by any performer to an audience would produce the
emotions which are the purpose of the regular drama, and which constitute
the entertainment of the audience."</p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Bishop</i><a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> an original song, "Come to Peckham
Rye," was composed and set to an old air. It was sung at music
halls with appropriate character dress, gesture, and expression.
The Court were of opinion that it was a dramatic piece, within
the meaning of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45. Kelly, C. B., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The plaintiff, by his powers of singing, acting, and characterisation,
had made this song a thing of value, not as a song merely, but as acted
by him in character, and so as a dramatic piece."</p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Wall</i> v. <i>Taylor</i><a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> it was suggested that by reason of the
interpretation clause in 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45, sec. 2, every musical
entertainment whatsoever was a "dramatic piece," but Brett,
M. R., refused to accept this view. In <i>Roberts</i> v. <i>Bignell</i>,<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> a very
imperfectly reported case, a divisional court (Day and Wills, JJ.)
held that a music hall song, "Oh, Jenny Dear!" the exact
nature of which is not apparent, was a "dramatic piece." The
leading case on this subject is now <i>Fuller</i> v. <i>Blackpool Winter
Gardens</i>,<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> and in this the doctrine which seemed to have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
growing up that every literary production with the least dramatic
flavour was a dramatic piece received a check. The subject of
this action was a popular music hall song called "Daisy Bell."
The song was sung in character costume, and the inference to
be drawn from the song itself and from the evidence was that it
was a composition intended for the stage either of the theatre or
of music halls. The Court of Appeal, sustaining the judgment
of Kennedy, J., held that the song was not a dramatic piece.
Lord Esher, M. R., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The fact that it is sung in costume does not make it a dramatic
piece. If the dress of the singer could have that operation, the singer
and not the author of the song would be the person who caused it to be a
dramatic piece. The same may be said of the manner in which the
singer treats the song. The question must be what was the character
of the composition when it was first written and published. I can quite
understand that it is possible that a thing to be performed by one person
only may be a dramatic piece. But whether the composition is to be
sung by one or more persons, if a song is sung, and only a song, there is
no performance of a dramatic piece."</p></blockquote>

<p>A. L. Smith, L. J., after reviewing the previous cases, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is not necessary to determine whether each of these cases was
rightly decided or whether the reasons given in each for holding the song
to be a dramatic piece are satisfactory. Every case must depend upon
its own attendant circumstances. In each case it is a question of fact.
I think that to constitute a song a dramatic piece it must be such a song
that for its proper representation, acting, and possibly scenery, formed a
necessary ingredient, and that if neither of these be a requisite to the
efficient representation of the song it is not a dramatic piece. It is an
entire misnomer to call a mere common, ordinary, music-hall song,
which required neither acting nor scenery for its production, a dramatic
piece, for it is in truth nothing of the kind."</p></blockquote>

<p>The result then seems to be that "dramatic" must not be used
in the widest sense of the term as suggested by Lord Denman,
C. J., in <i>Russell</i> v. <i>Smith</i>,<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> and that the test is not that of dramatic
or epic in the sense in which Lord Bacon applies the words
to poetry. There must be more than the dramatic flavour,
there must be the dramatic form; that is to say, the work must
be so constructed as to be obviously intended for reproduction
by means of acting with scenic effect. This test will apply
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
equally to non-musical as to musical works. A case in point
is that of the novel in <i>Toole</i> v. <i>Young</i>.<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> The facts as stated in
the judgment are:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"that Mr. Hollingshead wrote a story which he published in a work
called <i>Good Words</i>, and having in his mind at the time he wrote and
published it the intention of afterwards dramatizing the story, he composed
it very much of a dramatic character."</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet it was held that it was no infringement of the author's
right to put this novel into dramatic form and represent it on
the stage. If the novel could have been considered a dramatic
piece on account of its "dramatic character," it ought to have
been protected against the performance of an adaptation. Mr.
Scrutton in his book on copyright considers that "the dramatic
character consists in the representative as opposed to the narrative
element:" but this seems rather a return to the older
theory in <i>Russell</i> v. <i>Smith</i><a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> and contrary to <i>Fuller</i> v. <i>Blackpool
Winter Gardens</i>.<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> For instance, a poem, song, or piece for
recitation may be representative in that it depicts action and
dialogue rather than narrates events: this according to <i>Russell</i>
v. <i>Smith</i><a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> would constitute it a "dramatic piece," but according
to <i>Fuller</i> v. <i>Blackpool Winter Gardens</i><a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> we must find not only the
"representative element" but an element which requires acting
in order to represent it adequately.<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section IV.&mdash;What Dramatic Works are Protected:
Duration of Protection.</span></h3>

<p>It has been suggested by some writers that there is no
statutory protection of performing rights until first representation
in public.<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> It has also been suggested that the duration
of performing right is in every case for the period laid down by
5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45, <i>i. e.</i> forty-two years from first performance
or the author's life plus seven years. It is difficult to concur
in these views, which seem to imply that 5 &amp; 6 Vict. has taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
away from the dramatic author certain rights given to him by
3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15.</p>

<p>The law appears to stand thus. Before the statute of 3 and
4 Will. IV. c. 15 there was no statutory performing right.
Whether there was a common law performing right <i>quære</i>.<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> By
the Act of 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15 the author of a dramatic piece
not printed and published in book form is given a perpetual
performing right. This presumably dates from the composition
of the dramatic piece. If the dramatic piece is printed and
published as a book, the protection is then limited to twenty-eight
years from publication or for the life of the author,
whichever be the longer period. In neither case is the performing
right dependent for its existence on public performance.<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>
Then comes the Act of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45, which enacts in
section 20&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"that the provisions of the said Act of His late Majesty (3 &amp; 4 Will. IV.
c. 15) and of this Act shall apply to musical compositions, and that the
sole liberty of representing or performing or causing or permitting to be
represented or performed any dramatic piece or musical composition shall
endure and be the property of the author thereof and his assigns for
the term in this Act provided for the duration of copyright in books; and
the provisions hereinbefore enacted in respect of the property of such
copyright and of registering the same shall apply to the liberty of representing
or performing any dramatic piece or musical composition as if
the same were herein expressly re-enacted and applied thereto save and
except that the first public representation or performance of any dramatic
piece or musical composition shall be deemed equivalent in the construction
of this Act to the first publication of any book."</p></blockquote>

<p>As regards dramatic pieces which have been publicly performed
it is clear that the Act of Victoria gives them protection from
that date for forty-two years, or for the life of the author and
seven years.<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> But does 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45 take away the
protection given by 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15 to such dramatic
pieces as do not come within the provisions of the later statute,
<i>i. e.</i> unperformed dramatic pieces? It is submitted that it does
not, and this appears to be the view of Hawkins, J., in <i>Reichardt</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
v. <i>Sapte</i>,<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> the only decision on the point. In that case A
wrote a dramatic piece, B subsequently wrote one very similar:
B's drama was first performed, and a few days afterwards A's
drama was performed. In an action by B against A for infringement
of performing right, Hawkins, J., held that A had acquired
his performing right under 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. when he wrote
his drama. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In none of the enactments in 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45 will be found anything
which prejudicially affects the right of sole representation conferred
by the statute of 3 &amp; 4 Will IV. c. 15. The first production of a
dramatic piece mentioned in section 20 of the statute of Victoria confers
no priority upon the first producer, nor does it confer a title to the sole
liberty of representation. That is conferred by the statute 3 &amp; 4
Will. IV. c. 15 upon the author or his assignee: it<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> only fixes the first
production as the point from which (if entitled to it) the endurance of the
sole liberty of representation is to be calculated."</p></blockquote>

<p>What Hawkins, J., decided was that there is a vested statutory
interest in a dramatic piece immediately it is composed, and
although it is not quite clear from his judgment, it seems necessarily
to follow that the whole rights and remedies given by
3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15 still attach immediately on composition, and
that there is nothing in 5 &amp; 6 Vict. to divest the author of that
right. When a dramatic work is performed, no doubt the protection
to performing right is restricted as well as extended to
the period given by 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45, <i>i. e.</i> forty-two years from
the date of first performance, or life and seven years: but as
regards unperformed works, it is submitted that the performing
right is given by 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15 on composition, and is perpetual
if the work be not printed and published as a book within
the British dominions, or if it be printed and published as a
book, then for forty-two years from the date of publication as a
book, or for the author's life and seven years.</p>

<p>Extremely difficult questions may arise as regards performing
rights when a dramatic or musical work has been published as a
book or publicly performed outside the British dominions before
the first publication or the first public performance within the
British dominions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
</p>
<p>Section 19 of 7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. 12, provides:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That neither the author of any book, nor the author or composer of
any Dramatic Piece or Musical Composition ... which shall, after the
passing of this Act, be first published out of Her Majesty's Dominions,
shall have any copyright therein respectively, or any exclusive right to the
public representation or performance thereof, otherwise than such, if any,
as he may become entitled to under this Act."<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The whole difficulty lies in the meaning of the words "first
published" as applied to the performing right. In <i>Boucicault</i> v.
<i>Delafield</i>,<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> and <i>Boucicault</i> v. <i>Chatterton</i>,<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> it was held that when
an unpublished play was first performed outside the British
dominions the performing right in this country was extinguished.
"First published" was held to include the "first
performance" of a drama. This, however, only provides for
one possible contingency. As the literary exchange with
America, with which we have no international convention, is
becoming larger every year, it may be useful to consider some
of the other contingencies which may arise, and the difficulties
of which are not yet judicially solved. The cases suggested are
in connexion with the United States, but apply equally to any
foreign country, except in so far as rights may be acquired
under International Convention.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic or Musical Work unpublished, first performed in
America.</i>&mdash;This has been decided as above. The performing
right in this country is lost.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic or Musical Work first published in America, subsequently
first performed within the British Dominions.</i>&mdash;This
problem is not solved by the above cases. The alternative
views are that "publication" in the section means: (i) a putting
before the public in any form, whether by representation or in
print, or (ii) as regards copyright, a publication in print, as
regards performing right, a publication by representation. I am
inclined to think that the second alternative is the correct one,
and that the performing right in this country is not lost. The
contrary, however, seems to have been assumed in <i>Boucicault</i> v.
<i>Chatterton</i>,<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> both by the bench and bar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
</p>
<p><i>Dramatic or Musical Work first published in the British Dominions,
subsequently first performed in America.</i>&mdash;This problem depends
on the same two alternatives as the last. I therefore
think that the performing right here would be lost, even
although there was first publication as a book within the
British dominions.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic or Musical Work first performed in America, subsequently
first published in the British Dominions.</i>&mdash;The performing
right in this country would be lost, but probably not the copyright.</p>

<p><i>Dramatic or Musical Work first performed in the British
Dominions, subsequently first published in America.</i>&mdash;The performing
right in this country would be secured, but the copyright
lost.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section V.&mdash;What is a Musical Composition.</span></h3>

<p>The necessary originality in a musical composition consists
either in a new air or melody, or in the new arrangement and
adaptation of an old air. Thus an arrangement of an opera
for the pianoforte is an original work separate and distinct from
the opera itself.<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> So the adaptation of new words and accompaniment
to an old air is a musical composition entitled to protection.<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>
It must always be remembered, however, that a new
arrangement or adaptation will only be protected <i>quoad</i> its
novelty. In so far as the new work is taken from a non-copyright
work, an unauthorised taking of that part is not an infringement
of the new work.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section VI.&mdash;What Musical Works are Protected:
Duration of Protection.</span></h3>

<p>As in the case of dramatic works, so in the case of musical
compositions it is submitted that the statutory protection dates
from composition, not from first public performance. Musical
compositions are protected under the same provisions which
protect dramatic works. The protection is therefore identical,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
except as to the two amending statutes noticed below which do
not apply to dramatic works. It was contended in one case that
the extension of 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15 to musical compositions
was only applicable to musical compositions of a dramatic
nature.<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> This, however, is not the case, and all musical compositions
are protected.<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p>By the Copyright (Musical Compositions) Act, 1882, the performing
right in musical compositions which have been published
in "book" form is conditional<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> on a notice reserving the
performing right, and printed on every published copy. If
the copyright and performing right are in different hands
the owner of the performing right must give notice in writing
to the owner of the copyright, requiring him to print such
notice, and if the latter after due notice fail to do so, he
shall forfeit to the owner of the performing right the sum
of £20.</p>

<p>Even if the musical composition is also a dramatic piece or
part thereof, it comes within this requirement as to notice of
reservation on published copies.<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>

<p>Once a musical composition has been printed and published
without notice of reservation, it will probably be impossible to
obtain any protection for the performing right afterwards by
publishing copies with reservation.<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>A limited reservation is constantly made, and is probably
effectual, <i>e. g.</i> reserving the right to sing in music halls, but permitting
public performances elsewhere without fee or licence.<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section VII.&mdash;Registration of Performing Rights.</span></h3>

<p>Section 20 of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45 enacts that "the provisions
hereinbefore enacted" in respect of registering the copyright in
books shall apply to the liberty of representing or performing
any dramatic piece or musical composition; provided that in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
case of a dramatic piece or musical composition in manuscript it
shall be sufficient to register&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. The title.</span>
<span class="i0">2. The name and place of abode of author or composer.</span>
<span class="i0">3. The name and place of abode of the proprietor.</span>
<span class="i0">4. The time and place of first representation.</span>
</div></div>

<p>In the case, therefore, of a dramatic piece or musical composition
which has been published as a book, the proper registration
in respect of both copyright and performing right would
seem to be that provided by section II, viz.:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. The title.</span>
<span class="i0">2. The time of first publication.</span>
<span class="i0">3. The name and place of abode of the publisher.<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></span>
<span class="i0">4. The name and place of abode of the proprietor.<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is probably correct, although it may not strictly be in
accordance with the proviso in section 20, viz.:"save and
except that the first public representation or performance of
any dramatic piece or musical composition shall be deemed
equivalent in the construction of this Act to the first publication
of any book." If, however, the provision as to registration in
section 11 were strictly construed in accordance with this proviso,
the result is that the proper registration would be:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. The title.</span>
<span class="i0">2. The time of first representation.</span>
<span class="i0">3. The name and place of abode of the person who first represented it.</span>
<span class="i0">4. The name and place of abode of the proprietor.</span>
</div></div>

<p>It is obviously absurd that this should be the form of registration
when the dramatic piece or musical composition has
been printed and published, and that the form in section 20
should be the form of registration when it is in manuscript.
The distinction between the two forms is meaningless.</p>

<p>Section 24 of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45, which enacts that no action
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
for infringement of copyright shall be brought unless the book
is registered, provides "that nothing herein contained shall prejudice
the remedies which the proprietor of the sole liberty of
representing any dramatic piece shall have by virtue of the Act
3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15, or of this Act, although no entry shall be
made in the book of registry aforesaid."</p>

<p>The provisions as to registration of dramatic pieces are
therefore merely permissive and are in no way a condition precedent
either to the performing right itself or to the right of
action upon infringement;<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> but registration is <i>primâ facie</i> proof
of the right of representation subject to rebuttal by other
evidence.<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a></p>

<p>All the provisions as to the keeping of the registry book,<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>
making false entries therein,<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> and motion to expunge,<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> apply
equally to registration of a dramatic piece for the purpose of
protecting performing right as to registration of a book for the
purpose of protecting copyright.<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<p><b>Musical Compositions.</b>&mdash;The requisite registration is the same
as for performing rights in dramatic works; but <i>quære</i> whether in
the case of performing right in a musical composition it is not a
condition precedent to action. This doubt is raised by section
24, which provides that the registration of a book is a condition
precedent to an action for infringement of copyright, and it
specially excepts "the remedies which the proprietor of the sole
liberty of representing any dramatic piece shall have" from the
operation of the section. It is curious that "musical compositions"
are omitted from this saving clause, whereas in nearly
every other part of the Act "dramatic piece and musical compositions"
are dealt with together. The arguments against
registration being a condition precedent are, (1) the first part of
section 24 relates only to copyright which does not include
performing right; (2) section 20 does not extend the provisions
of section 24 to performing right, since it only applies
the provisions "<i>before</i> enacted." There is also a suggestion that
"dramatic piece" in the saving clause of section 24 includes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
"musical composition," since the definition of "dramatic piece"
in section 2 includes "musical or dramatic entertainment."
There is no authority directly in point. In <i>Russell</i> v. <i>Smith</i><a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> the
song called "The Ship on Fire" was protected without registration,
but then it was held to be a "dramatic piece" and something
more than a musical composition. In <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Bishop</i><a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> the song
protected was also held to be a "dramatic piece." In <i>Lacy</i> v.
<i>Rhys</i>,<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> where it was held that in the case of a dramatic piece
there was clearly no obligation to register, Crompton, J., said
that if it had not been for the proviso in section 24, there would
have been a doubt whether registration were not necessary.<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>

<p>In registering an unpublished arrangement of dance music

<h3><span class="smcap">Section VIII.&mdash;Assignment of Performing Rights.</span></h3>

<p>The performing right in dramatic pieces and musical compositions
can only be transferred by a written assignment<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>
or by entry on the register.<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> See decisions as to assignment
of copyright;<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> but note that as regards performing right
the assignment, even if before publication or performance,
must be in writing.<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> The performing right will not pass by a
mere conveyance of the copyright in a dramatic or musical
work<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> unless an entry shall be made of such assignment in the
register expressing the intention of the parties that such right
should pass.<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> As in the case of copyright, there is no express
enactment that assignment must be in writing; but it is inferred
from the fact that a licence which is a smaller right cannot be
given except by writing.<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> The assignment does not require to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
be by deed,<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> and if by written document it is valid without
registration.<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> Section 22 of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45 appears at first
sight to make registration necessary in every assignment of
performing right, at least if the copyright is assigned with it; but
this is not so. If in the written assignment there is a specific
conveyance of the performing right,<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> or if general words are
used such as "all other the estate, right, title, and interest,"
showing that something else than the copyright was intended
to be conveyed, the performing right will pass without registration.<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>
Cotton, L. J., in considering this section, says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I incline to think that this enactment was not meant to control the
operation of deeds of assignment, but only to regulate the effect of entries
in the registry book."<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In fact it was passed on account of <i>Cumberland</i> v. <i>Planché</i>,<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>
which decided that the assignee of the copyright took the performing
right as well.</p>

<p>If the view is right that the statutory performing right vests
immediately on production,<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> there can be no question of assignment
of common law rights.<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a></p>

<p>Performing rights can probably be partially assigned so as
to make a grantee of provincial rights not only a licensee but
an assignee, with full power to sue alone and re-assign.<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section IX.&mdash;Infringement of Dramatic Performing
Rights.</span></h3>

<p>By 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15, section 1, the author or his assignee
has "the sole liberty of representing, or causing to be represented,
at any place or places of dramatic entertainment whatsoever"
in the British dominions.</p>

<p><b>Public Performance.</b>&mdash;It is no infringement of performing
right in a dramatic work to represent it otherwise than in a
place of dramatic entertainment; but it has been held that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
any place where a dramatic work is publicly performed is for
the time being a place of dramatic entertainment. In <i>Lee</i> v.
<i>Simpson</i>,<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> Wilde, C. J., says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The legislature clearly meant places where dramatic entertainments
are represented to which the public are admitted."</p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Russell</i> v. <i>Smith</i><a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> the Court decided that a certain song,
"The Ship on Fire," was a dramatic piece. Denman, C. J.,
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It follows that as Crosby Hall was used for the public representation
for profit of a dramatic piece, it became a place of dramatic entertainment
for the time, within the statutes now in question. The use for
the time in question and not for a former time is the essential fact. As
a regular theatre may be a lecture-room, dining-room, ball-room, and
concert-room on successive days, so a room used ordinarily for either of
these purposes would become for the time being a theatre if used for the
representation of a regular stage play. In this sense, as "The Ship on
Fire" was a dramatic piece, in our view Crosby Hall, when used for the
public representation and performance of it for profit, became a place of
dramatic entertainment. In thus deciding we do not declare that the
defendant's performances at Crosby Hall were unlawful without a theatrical
licence within Stat. 6 &amp; 7 Vict. c. 68."<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the judgment of Brett, M. R., in <i>Wall</i> v. <i>Taylor</i><a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> there
is a suggestion that although a single item in a programme
might be dramatic, that would not be sufficient to render the
whole entertainment dramatic or to make the place a place of
dramatic performance. In <i>Duck</i> v. <i>Bates</i><a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> the defendant represented
a dramatic piece without the author's consent. The
representation took place in a room of Guy's Hospital, and was
provided entirely for the amusement of the nurses and attendants
of the hospital. The medical officers of the hospital, the
students and some of their friends were present. A reporter to
a theatrical newspaper was also present by invitation. It was
held by Brett, M. R., and Bowen, L. J. (Fry, L. J., dissenting), that
the room was not a place of dramatic entertainment. Neither
profit<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> nor habitual use were essential elements, but there must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
be a representation to which a portion of the public is admitted.
Brett, M. R., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Did the legislature intend to forbid a representation without the
author's consent by children in a nursery before their parents, or by
grown-up persons in a drawing-room? It is clear that something more
than that must have been intended; and why should not a representation
of that kind be called a dramatic entertainment? Because it is
obviously domestic and private. Suppose that the servants of the household
are invited to witness the performance; nevertheless it is a domestic
entertainment. As I have already intimated, the author wants protection
for the pecuniary value of his drama, and a representation in a private
room is of no pecuniary value. In order to entitle the author to
penalties there must be a representation which will injure the author's
right to money; such, for instance, as a representation which, although
it is not for profit, would attract persons who are willing to pay money,
and would induce them not to go and see a performance licensed by the
author. Suppose that a representation in the presence of friends takes
place for the amusement of friends and of the members of the household
in an unfurnished house hired for the occasion: that is not an infringement
of the statute: the representation must be other than domestic or
private. There must be present a sufficient part of the public who would
go also to a performance licensed by the author as a commercial transaction;
otherwise the place where the drama is represented will not be a
'place of dramatic entertainment' within the meaning of the statute.
Suppose that a drama is represented in a county town, and that all
persons of a certain class throughout the county are free to come:
suppose that a member for a parliamentary constituency (I do not mean
shortly before or during an election) organises dramatic entertainments to
which the inhabitants are admitted without paying: suppose that an
amateur company choose to act some drama for a charitable object, with
admission upon payment or by tickets issued generally: in each of these
instances an infringement of the statute has been committed.... I wish
to say, by way of warning, that those who go beyond the facts of the
present case may incur the penalties of the statute."</p></blockquote>

<p>This case is most instructive as being quite on the border
line between a private and public representation. Performing
right in a drama may be infringed by a representation without
scenery and appropriate dresses.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We should take away a part of the protection conferred on authors
if we hold that there could be no public representation without these
accompaniments."<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span></p>

<p><b>Substantial Part.</b>&mdash;As in literary copyright the part taken
must be material and substantial in order to infringe performing
right. In <i>Chatterton</i> v. <i>Cave</i>,<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> Lord Chief Justice Coleridge at the
trial found as a fact "that two scenes or points of the drama of
the defendant had been taken directly from the drama of the
plaintiff;" there was no further copying. He thereupon gave
judgment for the defendant. On a rule for a new trial, Lord
Coleridge, sitting in the Court of Common Pleas, stated orally
that what he meant to convey by his finding was, "that looking
to the general character of the plaintiff's and defendant's dramas,
the extent to which the one was taken from the other was so
slight, and the effect upon the total composition was so small,
that there was no substantial and material taking of any one
portion of the defendant's drama from any portion of the
plaintiff's." On this explanation the rule was discharged, and
the judgment subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeal and
the House of Lords. Lord Hatherley said that the principle
<i>de minimis non curat lex</i> applied to a supposed wrong in taking
a part of dramatic works as well as in reproducing a part of a
book. He could not read the word "part" in the Dramatic
Copyright Act as "particle," so that the crowing of the cock in
"Hamlet," or the introduction of a line in the dialogue might be
held to be an invasion. In <i>Planché</i> v. <i>Braham</i>,<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> Tindal, C. J.,
directed the jury that if either one song, or more than one song
be taken from a piece and be performed on the stage or any
place of theatrical entertainment, that would be a "representing"
within the Act of Parliament. The jury, having found that
the defendant had represented "a part of the plaintiff's opera,"
a rule for a new trial was refused.<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> In <i>Beere</i> v. <i>Ellis</i>,<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> two plays
purported to be founded on the same novel. The defendant's
play contained some of the dialogue and several dramatic incidents
and situations taken directly from the plaintiff's play.
Baron Pollock held that a small piece of dialogue would not
alone amount to an infringement, but the defendant had taken
two dramatic incidents on which the plot of the play depended.
He had therefore taken a material part, and although he had done
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
a considerable quantity of work for himself, he had "extracted
the plums" from the plaintiff's work, and this he was not entitled
to do. An indirect taking is, as in literary copyright, an infringement,
<i>e. g.</i> to copy and perform passages from a play by dramatizing
a novel founded on that play.<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> It is no infringement to
produce a play almost identically similar to that of another
author, if this is the result of coincidence and not of any piracy
direct or indirect.<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> As to the taking of a plan or idea, see the
chapter on infringement of literary copyright.<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> There must be
more than the taking of a general idea or scheme. Lord Blackburn,
in <i>Chatterton</i> v. <i>Cave</i>,<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"An idea may be taken from a drama and used in forming another
without the representation of the second being a representation of any
part of the first. For example, I have no doubt that Sheridan in composing
'The Critic' took the idea from 'The Rehearsal,' but I think it
would be an abuse of language to say that those who represent 'The
Critic' represent 'The Rehearsal,' or any part thereof, and if it were left
to me to find the fact, I should without hesitation find that they did not.
On the other hand, in composing 'The Trip to Scarborough,' Sheridan
took so much from 'The Relapse,' that if it were left to me to find the
fact, I should find that those who represent 'The Trip to Scarborough'
do represent parts of 'The Relapse.'"</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Causing to be Represented.</b>&mdash;The "penalty" prescribed by
the Act of 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15 is recoverable from those who
"represent or cause to be represented" an unauthorised work.
Section 20 of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45 provides "that the sole liberty
of representing, or performing, or causing or permitting to be
represented or performed, any dramatic piece or musical composition,
shall endure," &amp;c. Notice that this section uses the
word "permitting," whereas 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15 only uses
"represent or cause to be represented." The later statute, however,
does not purport to extend the nature of performing right,
and therefore the word "permitting," if it have any meaning at
all, can only be explanatory of the words "cause to be represented"
in the earlier statute. When then does a person "cause
a dramatic piece to be represented"? Shortly, the answer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
probably is, that if he does not actually take part as an actor,
the defendant must be shown to have had some initiation in or
control over the performance. In <i>Parsons</i> v. <i>Chapman</i>,<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> an
acting manager, who paid the performers' salaries, and was
entitled to dismiss them, was held to have caused a dramatic
piece to be represented within the meaning of 10 Geo. III. c. 28,
sec. 1. In <i>Russell</i> v. <i>Briant</i>,<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> the defendant was the landlord of
"The Horns" Tavern, at Kennington. His premises included
a large assembly room which was hired for evening entertainments.
The defendant furnished the platform and the lights, and
allowed bills to be put up in the tavern, and tickets of admission
to be advertised to be sold at the bar. At one entertainment
a song, "The Ship on Fire," which in <i>Russell</i> v. <i>Smith</i><a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> was held
to be a copyright dramatic piece, was sung. It was held that
the defendant had not represented or caused to be represented
the dramatic piece in question. Wilde, C. J., said that no one
could be considered as an offender unless by himself or his agent
he actually took part in the representation. In <i>Lyon</i> v. <i>Knowles</i><a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>
the defendant let his theatre. He provided and paid for the
scenery, lights, printing, advertising, band, doorkeepers, scene-shifters,
and supernumeraries. His servants collected the money
at the door, and he retained half the gross profits to recoup
himself. The lessee brought his own company, and represented
pieces of his own choice, the defendant having no control over
any person employed in the representation. It was held that the
defendant had not caused the piece to be represented within the
meaning of the Acts. In <i>Marsh</i> v. <i>Conquest</i><a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> the defendant was
the proprietor of a theatre, and his son, the acting manager,
hired it for a "benefit." The Court held that the defendant
came within the statute. Erle, C. J., delivered the judgment of
the Court:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It appears that the defendant is the proprietor of the Grecian Theatre,
and the employer of the dramatic corps attached thereto; that his son,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
the stage manager, hired for his benefit-night the theatre, together with
the company of actors, and servants, and lights, for the sum of £30; and
that the son, in the defendant's theatre, and with the aid of his actors and
actresses, musicians, servants, lights, and other paraphernalia, represented
the dramatic piece in question, in violation of the plaintiff's sole and exclusive
right of representing or causing it to be represented. I think the
defendant is responsible for that representation. He was the proprietor
of the theatre, and had entire control over the establishment and all
belonging to it, and what was done by his son was done with his
permission."</p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Monaghan</i> v. <i>Taylor</i><a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> the defendant was the proprietor of
a music hall, and paid a singer to perform, leaving him his own
choice of songs. The singer sang a copyright song. The Court
held that the defendant came within the statute. This decision
would not now apply to musical performing right, since, by the
Musical Copyright Act of 1888, a proprietor is not liable unless
he permits the performance knowing it to be an infringement.
It is still applicable to dramatic performing rights. Suppose, for
instance, the proprietor of a variety theatre hired the services of
a troop of players, telling them to fill up twenty minutes on
the programme with any dramatic scene they pleased. If
they infringed a dramatic copyright, the proprietor would
be liable.</p>

<p>It seems to be doubtful whether if B, acting entirely as the
agent of A, causes C and others to perform a dramatic piece, he
can be held liable if he took no part in the representation. In
<i>Parsons</i> v. <i>Chapman</i><a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> Lord Tenterden, C. J., directed the jury
that it was sufficient if the defendant caused the piece to be
performed; and that it made no difference that he did so as
an agent for others. This was a decision under 10 Geo. II.
c. 28, and the principle should be the same under 3 &amp; 4
Will. IV., and 5 &amp; 6 Vict; but in <i>French</i> v. <i>Day</i><a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> Kennedy,
J., took a different view. One of the defendants was the
manager of a theatre. He received instructions for the production
of the piece in question from the proprietor, and he
could not engage or dismiss artistes; he was in every respect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
bound to conform to his employer's orders. Kennedy, J.,
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The whole thing was carried on by the proprietor, who merely used
the manager as his mouthpiece. I think I ought not to hold that a
person in his position 'represented,' or 'caused to be represented,' the
piece."</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Knowledge.</b>&mdash;In an action for infringement of dramatic performing
right it is unnecessary to prove that the defendant knew
the performance was an infringement.<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<p><b>Innocent Agents.</b>&mdash;All the actors who take part in an unlawful
performance are within the section as "representing," and are
liable to penalties.<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a></p>

<p><b>Licence.</b>&mdash;It is an infringement of performing right to perform
"without the consent in writing of the author or other
proprietor."<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> See decisions on licence as to copyright in books.<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a>
The licence must be in writing,<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> but it does not require to be
written by the proprietor or signed by him or any one else.<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a>
The secretary of a dramatic author's society may, if he has
authority, grant a good licence on behalf of the authors.<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> A
part owner cannot grant a licence without the consent of the
other part owners.<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section X.&mdash;Infringement of Musical Performing
Rights.</span></h3>

<p><b>Substantial Part.</b>&mdash;The rule that the taking of a part but not
of a particle in infringement applies equally to musical compositions
and to the performing rights therein. In <i>D'Almaine</i>
v. <i>Boosey</i><a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> the taking of airs from an opera and arranging them
as quadrilles and waltzes was held to be an infringement of the
copyright in the opera. Lord Lyndhurst said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Substantially the piracy is when the appropriated music, though
adapted to a different purpose from that of the original, may still be
recognised by the ear."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span></p>

<p>This test, however, will hardly apply to the piracy of an
adaptation where the air or melody is a non-copyright one.
A comparison of the actual notes and treatment of the phrases
would have to be made.</p>

<p><b>Public Performance.</b>&mdash;It has been contended that the protection
afforded by 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15 to musical compositions
is only an exclusive right of performance in places
of dramatic entertainment. That is the protection given to
dramatic pieces, and it was said that 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45, in
applying 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15 to musical compositions did
not give them a wider protection than dramatic pieces had.
In <i>Wall</i> v. <i>Taylor</i><a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> the Court held that this view was wrong.
Bowen, L. J., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I think the answer is this, that what is called in the argument a
'condition' of recovering a penalty in sec. 2 of 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15 is
nothing of the kind, but part of the definition of the offence upon which
the penalty is to be incurred.... The right granted is the privilege of
representing at places of dramatic entertainment.... Now sec. 20
of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45 creates a new right of property as to a musical composition,
and gives the author and his assigns the sole liberty of representing
or performing it. That is the right given, and sec. 21 says
that the person who shall have that right 'shall have and enjoy the
remedies given and provided' in the Act of 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15.
Why read into that word 'remedies' that the second section of that Act
is only to be put in force not where there is an infringement of that right,
but where there has been a representation or performance at a place of
dramatic entertainment."</p></blockquote>

<p>The view of Cotton, L. J., in the same case was that the
remedies of 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15 were not applicable unless
the musical composition was performed in a place of dramatic
entertainment; but that in every case of public performance
there was a remedy under 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45 for damages and
injunction. Since the Musical Copyright Act of 1888 the distinction
between these opinions has become immaterial, for in
every case in which the performance is actionable at all the
Court may assess the damages as it thinks proper.</p>

<p><b>Causing to be Represented.</b>&mdash;The offence is representing or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
"causing to be represented." As to what the latter includes
see page 139, on performing right in dramatic pieces. The
liability for "causing to be represented" differs from that in the
case of dramatic pieces in that since the Copyright (Musical
Compositions) Act, 1888, "the proprietor, tenant, or occupier of
any place of dramatic entertainment or other place at which any
unauthorised representation or performance of any musical
composition shall take place ... shall not by reason of such
representation or performance be liable to any penalty or
damages in respect thereof, unless he shall wilfully cause or
permit such unauthorised representation or performance, knowing
it to be unauthorised."<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> In respect of those who are not
proprietors, tenants, or occupiers the liability is the same as in
the infringement of dramatic performing right.</p>

<p><b>What is an Original Engraving.</b>&mdash;By 8 Geo. II. c. 13
(1734) copyright is given to "every person who shall invent
and design, engrave, etch, or work in mezzotinto or chiaro
oscuro, or from his own works and invention shall cause to
be designed and engraved, etched, or worked in mezzotinto or
chiaro oscuro any historical or other print or prints."</p>

<p>In <i>Blackwell</i> v. <i>Harper</i><a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> (1740) it was decided that the above
Act was not limited to works of invention such as an historical
group, but extended to the "designing or engraving anything
that is already in nature."</p>

<p>In <i>Jefferys</i> v. <i>Baldwin</i><a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> (1753) it was held that prints of herring
fishing-boats were not within the protection of the Act.</p>

<p>By 7 Geo. III. c. 38 (1766), which was passed in consequence
probably of the doubt thrown upon the earlier Act by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
the above and other decisions, the copyright in engravings is
given to "all and every person or persons who shall invent or
design, engrave, etch, or work in mezzotinto or chiaro oscuro, or
from his own work, design, or invention shall cause or procure
to be designed, engraved, etched, or worked in mezzotinto or
chiaro oscuro any historical print or prints, or any print or prints
of any portrait, conversation, landscape, or architecture, map,
chart, or plan, or any other print or prints whatsoever," and "to
all and every person who shall engrave, etch, or work in mezzotinto
or chiaro oscuro, or cause to be engraved, etched, or
worked any print taken from any picture, drawing, model, or
sculpture either ancient or modern."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this widely worded protection, doubts arose
as to whether lithographs and certain new processes of reproducing
prints came within the Acts, and in consequence a clause
was inserted in the Copyright Act of 1852<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> whereby it was
declared that the provisions of the Engraving Acts were intended
to include prints taken by lithography or any other mechanical
process by which prints or impressions of drawings or designs
are capable of being multiplied indefinitely.</p>

<p>Prints of every description, therefore, are protected under the
Engraving Acts, and it is immaterial whether the design produced is:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. The imaginative invention of the maker,</span>
<span class="i0">2. Taken from some object in nature, or</span>
<span class="i0">3. Taken from some other work of art, such as a picture or model.</span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Originality.</i>&mdash;The only originality required is an originality in
execution, <i>i. e.</i> the work must not be taken from some other print
and reproduce from that other print those characteristics of
execution wherein the peculiar merit of the engraver's art lies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The engraver produces his effects by the management of light and
shade, or as the term of his art expresses it, the <i>chiaro oscuro</i>. The due
degrees of light and shade are produced by different lines and dots; he
who is the engraver must decide on the choice of the different lines or
dots for himself, and on his choice depends the success of his print. If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
he copies from another engraving he may see how the person who engraved
that has produced the desired effect, and so without skill or
attention become a successful rival."<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Map, Chart, or Plan.</i>&mdash;It will be remembered that maps,
charts, and plans are included under the definition of books in the
Copyright Act, 1842,<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> and receive protection as such. Doubt has
consequently been raised as to whether a map must comply with
both the Engraving Acts and the Literary Act in order to obtain
protection, or whether it will be sufficient to comply with the
requirements of one only, and if so, which. The decided cases
are unsatisfactory. In <i>Stannard</i> v. <i>Lee</i><a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> protection was claimed
for a "Panoramic Bird's-eye view of France and Prussia," with the
railway and strategic positions illustrating the Franco-Prussian War
of 1870. This was not registered as a book under the Copyright
Act, 1842, and the objection was held to be fatal. The judges in
the Court of Appeal seemed to be of opinion that the Act of
1842 had taken maps, charts, and plans out of the protection of
the Engraving Acts and placed them under the protection of the
Literary Act, consequently that the requirements of the latter and
not of the Engraving Acts must be observed. James, L. J.,
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was reasonable and proper to take a map out of the class of
artistic copyrights and to give to it the better and more complete copyright
which is intended to be given to literary works. And there would
be, as I have pointed out clearly, great inconvenience in having two laws
of copyright as to two sets of maps or as to the same set of maps."<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Mellish, L. J., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I think it is a perfectly rational enactment that maps shall no longer
be included among works of art but be classed in future with literary
works."<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>After this case had been decided a petition was brought to
the Court praying that another case, <i>Stannard</i> v. <i>Harrison</i>,<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> in
which the same map had been copied, and to which the defendants
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
had consented to a decree for injunction and damages,
should be reheard. Bacon, V. C., refused the petition, and indicated
in the course of his judgment that a map not registered
as a book might be protected as an engraving if the claim was
properly stated. The judgment in <i>Stannard</i> v. <i>Lee</i>,<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> he said, had
gone on a question of pleading, the plaintiffs having voluntarily
brought their map under the category of books. This is by no
means a satisfactory explanation of the decision in the Court of
Appeal, as it is abundantly clear from the judgments as reported
that in the view of the Lords Justices the Copyright Act, 1842,
took maps, charts, and plans out of the category of artistic works
and placed them in the category of literary works. Whether this
is a correct view is another matter, but at present it would seem
to be law. It is submitted that the true view probably is that a
map may be protected under either Act if the requisite formalities
are observed. The Literary will probably give a wider protection
than the Engraving Acts. The Engraving Acts will protect
a map from infringement of the method of execution, that is to
say, the work which is the peculiar work of the engraver; while
the Literary Act will protect it not only from that, but from a
piratical taking of information imparted. Thus suppose a map
of India giving battles and dates and, say, the principal products
of the various districts marked with printed letters on the surface.
It is difficult to see how the taking of all these dates and products
and placing them perhaps printed in different letters on
the new map could be an infringement of the engraving copyright
in the map; there is nothing in the nature of a design or
drawing taken; and yet it is quite clear it will be an infringement
under the protection afforded by a literary copyright, because
there is a taking of the particular expression by which information
is imparted.</p>

<p><i>Engravings in a book</i> are protected by the Copyright Act, 1842,
as part of the book, and, as such, do not require to comply with
the requirements of the Engraving Acts.<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> The protection of a
print forming part of a book is probably a double one, and if it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
had the name and date inscribed would be protected without
registration or notwithstanding faulty registration of the book.</p>

<p><b>Must the Engraving be made within the British Dominions.</b>&mdash;The
Act 17 Geo. III. c. 57 giving a remedy by action for
damages is expressly confined to works made in Great Britain.
The other two Acts, 8 Geo. II. c. 13 and 7 Geo. III. c. 38, are not
expressly limited to works there made, but it has been held that
the limitation is to be supplied in them.<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is plain that the object of the legislature was to protect those
works which were designed, engraved, etched, or worked in Great Britain,
and not those which were designed, engraved, etched, or worked abroad,
and only published in Great Britain."<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Act 6 &amp; 7 Will. IV. c. 59 extends the application of the
Engraving Acts to Ireland, and in section 2 there is a general
proviso protecting "any engraving or print of any description
whatever ... which may have been or which shall hereafter
be published in any part of Great Britain or Ireland." It is
quite arguable that this extends the protection to engravings
wherever made if published in the United Kingdom; but probably
it would be held to be only applicable to engravings made
in the United Kingdom, and is merely a proviso that there will
be no copyright until publication in the United Kingdom. The
point, however, is one of great uncertainty.</p>

<p>Under the International Copyright Act, 1886,<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> works first
produced anywhere within the British dominions are protected
equally with those first produced in the United Kingdom. The
doubt still remains whether the engraving must not be made as
well as first published within the British dominions.</p>

<p><b>The Engraving must be first Published within the British
Dominions.</b>&mdash;There is no protection until publication<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a> except
at common law. Publication is an act which gives to the
public an opportunity on payment or otherwise of viewing
the print. There may probably be publication without offering
copies for sale or distribution. See as to publication of books<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>
and pictures;<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> but the analogy is not complete with either.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
There seems to be no direct authority as to what constitutes
publication of an engraving.</p>

<p>Before 1886 the work had to be published in the United
Kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> Now first publication anywhere within the British
dominions will be sufficient to secure the copyright.<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></p>

<p><b>Date of First Publication and Proprietor's Name.</b>&mdash;It is a
condition precedent to protection that there must be truly
engraved on each plate, and printed on every print or prints<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">i.</span> The name of the proprietor;</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">ii.</span> The day of first publication.</span>
</div></div>

<p>This qualification of the engraver's right is only inserted in
8 Geo. II. c. 13, and not in the subsequent Acts which extend
the protection to works not there included and give remedies
not there given. It has been held, however, that as the Acts
are <i>in pari materia</i> they must be taken together, and the qualification
in the first read into the others.<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></p>

<p>The proviso as to the name and date is a condition precedent
to protection, and not merely directory.<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> In one case Lord
Hardwicke thought that, although no action for penalties would
lie unless the name and date were correctly published, an injunction
might be granted even although the name and date
were not published at all.<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> He was probably wrong.</p>

<p><i>Name of Proprietor.</i>&mdash;There is some little doubt as to whether
this must be the name of the person who was proprietor at the
date of first publication or at the date on which protection is
claimed. In <i>Thompson</i> v. <i>Symonds</i><a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> Lord Kenyon said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The name of the proprietor should appear in order that those who
wish to copy it might know to whom to apply for consent. It seems,
therefore, necessary that the date should remain, but that the name of
the proprietor should be altered as often as the property is changed."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span></p></blockquote>

<p>But Buller, J., in the same case, thought the proprietor always
meant the inventor and first proprietor, notwithstanding the
property had passed to his assignee. The point is certainly
doubtful, but the latter view that the name of the first proprietor
only need be on the print seems the more reasonable, and not
contrary to the wording of the Act. The proprietor need not
be described as such on the plate.<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> If his name is there it
is sufficient, even if there is more than one name and it is
uncertain which is the proprietor.<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> The proprietor need not
be described by his full name, his surname is sufficient.<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> When
a partnership firm are proprietors of an engraving the trading
name of the firm is a sufficient designation, inasmuch as it
enables parties to know whom to apply to for information.<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>
If a single proprietor trades under the designation of A. B. &amp; Co.
that is a sufficient designation.<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a></p>

<p><b>Immoral Works.</b>&mdash;There will be no copyright in profane,
libellous, or indecent prints.<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a></p>

<p><b>Duration of Protection.</b>&mdash;The statutory right begins on
publication, and runs for twenty-eight years from the day of
first publishing.<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

<p>After publication protection will depend entirely on the
statute.<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a></p>

<p>Before publication there is a common law right to prevent
all interference with what is a man's private property,<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> and to
protect this the formalities prescribed by the statute need not
be complied with.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section II.&mdash;The Owner of the Copyright</span>.</h3>

<p><b>The Engraver.</b>&mdash;The persons to whom the copyright is
given by the Acts are, "Every person and persons who shall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
invent or design, engrave, etch, or work in mezzotinto or chiaro
oscuro, or from his own work, design, or invention, shall cause
or procure to be designed, engraved, etched, or worked in
mezzotinto or chiaro oscuro any prints ... and every person
who shall engrave, etch, or work in mezzotinto or chiaro oscuro,
or cause to be engraved, etched, or worked any print taken from
any picture."</p>

<p>The engraver, therefore, is the first owner of the copyright
when he does the work on his own behalf, or, if he does it
on behalf of another, executes it entirely from his own work,
design, or invention.</p>

<p><b>The Employer.</b>&mdash;When one man employs another to execute
an engraving it would seem that by the Acts<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> the copyright
vests <i>ab initio</i> in the employer:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. In the case of an engraving taken from another work of art.</span>
<span class="i0">2. In the case of an engraving with an original design,
if it is executed from the employer's own work,
design, or invention.</span>
</div></div>

<p>An employer may be the inventor of a design even although
he is unable to draw, and would himself be unable to execute
it. For instance, in the case<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> of a war map for the Franco-Prussian
war in 1870, it was held that a publisher who had
employed an engraver, giving him material and instructions
from time to time was the inventor, and therefore the first owner
in the copyright in the map. Bacon, V. C., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As to whether the design or invention is that of the plaintiff or not
is a mere matter of character.... The compiler has proved that it is
the design of the plaintiff; that the plaintiff brought to him his rough
sketch or draught, a drawing of the same size as the stone on which it
was to be engraved, pointing out, as the compiler has said, 'a rough
sketch of the forts and towns to give me an idea; he furnished me also
with a large French map, and some maps published in the <i>Times</i> and
<i>Daily Telegraph</i>; he gave me notice also daily of the earthworks that
were made and produced, besides a picture published in the <i>Illustrated
London News</i>.' That the plaintiff cannot draw himself is a matter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
wholly unimportant if he has caused other persons to draw for him. He
invents the subject of the design beyond all question. He prescribes the
proportions and the contents of the design; he furnishes a part of the
materials from which the drawing has to be made in the first instance,
and afterwards collects daily from the proper sources, and even, if it be
necessary to say so, from official sources, the decrees, the reports, the
bulletins and accounts contained in the newspapers of the different
phases of the war, and especially of the places in which earthworks are
thrown up. These he communicates to the man whom he has employed
to make a drawing for him.... It is clear to my mind that this is a
work of diligence, industry, and for aught I know of genius on the part
of the plaintiff, for the notion never seems to have occurred to the
compiler himself."</p></blockquote>

<p>If the person employed is the servant of the employer and
not an independent contractor, the whole right in the engraving
will probably, irrespective of the Acts, vest <i>ab initio</i> in the
employer.<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a></p>

<p><b>The Assignee.</b>&mdash;In one case<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> it was contended that there
could be no assignment under the Engraving Acts enabling an
assignee to sue in his own name, since these Acts only provide
for the licence and exemption from liabilities of a purchaser.<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a>
It was held, however, that there could be an assignment, and
that the assignee could sue in his own name.<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a></p>

<p>As a licence is required to be in writing, signed by the proprietor
and in the presence of two or more credible witnesses,<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a>
so must the assignment which passes a greater right.<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a></p>

<p>The sale of plates will not in itself operate as an assignment;<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a>
but, if it were clearly intended to pass the whole right,
probably it would pass with the plates without assignment in
writing.<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a></p>

<p>Before publication the whole right in the engraving, <i>i. e.</i> the
common law right, may be assigned without writing.<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section III.&mdash;Infringement of the Copyright.</span></h3>

<p><b>Prohibited Acts and Remedies.</b>&mdash;It is an offence "for any

<p>Penalties and delivery of plates or copies may also be
recovered by summary proceeding before any two justices
having jurisdiction where the party offending resides.<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a></p>

<p><i>Guilty Knowledge.</i>&mdash;It will be noticed that in order to recover
penalties and forfeiture of copies under 8 Geo. II. c. 13, for the
offence of selling a piratical copy, it must have been committed
knowing the copy to have been produced without consent. In
17 Geo. III. c. 57, however, the offence for which an action for
damages lies is merely "selling," thus not requiring proof of
guilty knowledge. It has been contended that the requirement
of guilty knowledge in 8 Geo. II. c. 13, should be read into 17
Geo. III. c. 57, and the action of damages provided by the latter
statute applied to guilty selling only. This contention has been
rejected as erroneous.<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a></p>

<p><i>Limitation of Action.</i>&mdash;Actions for penalties under the Acts
must be brought within three months of the discovery of the
offence sued on<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> and within six months after the committal of
such offence.<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a></p>

<p>There is no express limitation in the Acts in respect of actions
for damages under 17 Geo. III. c. 57, and therefore such action
will not be barred for six years.<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></p>

<p><i>Costs.</i>&mdash;The litigant if successful in an action for infringement
is to recover "full costs."<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> This proviso, however, has
been construed to mean nothing more than ordinary costs taxed
as between party and party.<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> Probably, however, they may be
claimed as of right and are not in the discretion of the Court
under Rules of the Supreme Court, o. 65, r. 1.<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a></p>

<p><i>Copying for Private Use</i> will probably be actionable under
17 Geo. III. c. 57;<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> but no penalties could be recovered under
8 Geo. II. c. 13, as under that Act the making must be a making
for sale.</p>

<p><b>What is a Piratical Copy.</b>&mdash;The right under the Acts is "the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
sole right and liberty of printing and reprinting the same,"<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> and
the prohibition is against "engraving, etching, or working in
mezzotinto or chiaro oscuro or otherwise, or in any manner
copying, in the whole or in part, by varying, adding to or
diminishing from, the main design."<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a></p>

<p>The taking of a material part is a piracy;<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> the copy which
contains a material part of a copyright engraving is a piratical
copy, and it is an offence to import or sell it.<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a></p>

<p>The copyright in an engraving may be infringed otherwise
than by another engraving. Thus a photograph of an engraving
is an infringement of the copyright in it.<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a></p>

<p>It is doubtful how far the Engraving Acts protect the design
in an engraving. It is clear that when an engraving is taken
from a work of art previously existing, such as a pen and ink
drawing or a painting, the engraving is only copyright so far as
the work of the engraver<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> is concerned; that is to say, apart
from the copyright in the drawing or painting, which may or
may not be his, the engraver acquires no monopoly<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> of the
right to engrave the picture; the fact of his being the first
engraver does not prevent others from doing the same, they
can only be prevented from copying from his engraving the
peculiar execution of the design. In <i>Dicks</i> v. <i>Brooks</i><a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> a printed
pattern for Berlin wool work was taken from an engraving of
the well-known picture "The Huguenot," by Millais. The
owner of the copyright in the engraving sued for infringement.
It was held that the printed pattern constituted no infringement
of his engraving; it contained no reproduction of that which
was the engraver's meritorious work in the print. But if the
whole invention and design of the engraving is the engraver's
own do the Engraving Acts protect the engraver in such design
and invention? There is no authority where the point has
been expressly considered and decided. It is suggested that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
the Engraving Acts protect that part of an engraving only which
is the result of the engraver's peculiar art; for the rest, for the
design, for the invention, for the grouping of the figures, protection
can only be obtained under the Act protecting drawings, or
(in the case of maps) under the Literary Copyright Act, or at
common law. In <i>Roworth</i> v. <i>Wilkes</i><a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> Lord Ellenborough considered
a copying of the design was an infringement of copyright
under the Engraving Acts. The action was in respect of
an alleged infringement of certain plates in a treatise on fencing.
These plates had been copied in so far as the position of the
figures went, but they were represented as differently dressed.
His Lordship, in directing the jury, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As to the prints, the question will be whether the defendant has
copied the main design ... it is still to be considered whether there be
such a similitude and conformity between the prints that the person who
executed the one set must have used the others as a model. In that case
he is a copyist of the main design. But if the similitude can be supposed
to have arisen from accident, or necessarily from the nature of the subject,
or from the artist having sketched designs merely from reading the letterpress
of the plaintiffs work, the defendant is not answerable. It is
remarkable, however, that he has given no evidence to explain the
similitude or to repel the presumption which that necessarily causes."</p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Martin</i> v. <i>Wright</i><a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> it was held that when an artist had from
sketches of his own produced an engraving, and the defendant
had it copied on canvas in colours on a very large scale, with
dioramic effect, and publicly exhibited it, such a copying and
exhibiting was no infringement of the engraving. The ground
of this decision seems to have been partly that the merit
of the new work had absorbed the merit of the old. Thus
Shadwell, V. C., prefaces his judgment with the remark that
"any person may copy and publish the whole of a literary
composition provided he writes notes upon it, so as to
present it to the public connected with matter of his own."<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>
Another ground of the decision seems to have been that the
diorama was produced for purposes of exhibition and not of
sale. The real point, whether the Acts protected more than that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
which was peculiar to the engraver's art, does not appear to have
been considered either in the argument or judgment. In <i>Dicks</i>
v. <i>Brooks</i><a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> James, L. J., appears to have been of opinion that
8 Geo. II. c. 3, in protecting the work of an engraver where the
invention and design was his own, protected not only the work
peculiar to the engraver's art, but the invention and design of
the pictures as well.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"These words were intended to give protection for the genius exhibited
in the invention of the design, and the protection was commensurate
with the invention and design."<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Bramwell, L. J., however, seems inclined towards the opposite
view. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I do not say that if this were an ordinary engraving with no picture,
a lithograph taken from it would not be a copy. I think that a photograph
taken from it would be a copy. I do not say that if this were an
original engraving with no picture, and a copy were made of it and afterwards
coloured there might not be some ground for saying that there was
a piracy of the art and skill of the engraver. I should have very great
misgiving about it, because I doubt whether the statutes were not intended
to protect the artist's skill as an engraver only, and not as a
draftsman."<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is no defence to an action for infringement that the work
has been extensively added to or improved.<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></p>

<p>Striking prints from the proprietor's own plate has been
held not to be an infringement, although it was clearly an
unauthorised act and a breach of contract.<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> Thus a printer who
had plates in his possession would not infringe the copyright
and be liable to penalties by striking copies for his own use, but
he would be liable in damages for breach of contract.</p>

<p><i>Licence a Defence.</i>&mdash;A licence in order to be a defence must be
in writing signed by the proprietor in the presence of two or
more credible witnesses,<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> but a licensee who is also a purchaser
of any plates for printing may presumably without any document
in writing print from the said plates without incurring penalties<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
under 8 Geo. II. c. 13 or 7 Geo. III. c. 38, but <i>quære</i> whether
such purchaser would not technically be liable to damages
under 17 Geo. III. c. 57. A bare licensee, although a purchaser
of plates, could not authorise third persons to print from the
plates except as his agent and on his behalf.<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

COPYRIGHT IN SCULPTURE</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section I.&mdash;What Works are Protected.</span></h3>

<p>The following works are protected under the Sculptures Act:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. Every original sculpture:<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a></span>
<span class="i0">2. First published within the British dominions:<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a></span>
<span class="i0">3. [The author of which is a British subject or resident within the British dominions]:<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a></span>
<span class="i0">4. Which bears the proprietor's name and the date [of first publication] thereon:<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a></span>
<span class="i0">5. And is innocent.<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Protection endures for fourteen years from publication, and
another term of fourteen years if the author is then alive and
retains the copyright.<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a></p>

<p>Protection is probably limited by implication to the United
Kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></p>

<p><b>What is an Original Sculpture.</b>&mdash;The work protected is "any
new and original sculpture, or model, or copy, or cast of the
human figure or human figures, or of any bust or busts or of
any part or parts of the human figure clothed in drapery or
otherwise, or of any subject being matter of invention in
sculpture, or of any alto or basso-relievo representing any of the
matters or things hereinbefore mentioned, or any cast from
nature of the human figure or of any part or parts of the human
figure, or of any cast from nature of any animal or of any part
or parts of any animal, or of any such subject containing any of
the matters or things hereinbefore mentioned, whether separate
or combined."<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a></p>

<p>In one case it was contended that the Act only applied to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
representations of human figures and animals. North, J., however,
held that "any new and original sculpture" applied to any
subject "being matter of invention in sculpture," and that casts
of fruit and leaves used for instruction in drawing were protected.<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a></p>

<p>Carefully modelled toy soldiers have been protected as works
of sculpture.<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a></p>

<p><b>The Sculpture must be First Published within the British
Dominions.</b>&mdash;The Act provides that protection shall run from the
first publication of the work.<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> Before 1886 it is possible that
first publication within the United Kingdom was required, now
first publication anywhere within the British dominions will vest
the copyright;<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> first publication outside the British dominions
will destroy it.<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a></p>

<p><i>Publication.</i>&mdash;A work of sculpture is published when the
"eye of the public"<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a> is allowed to rest upon it, that is to say when
the sculpture itself and not merely a photographic copy or sketch
is so exhibited that the general public have an opportunity of
viewing it.<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> Exhibition in any public gallery such as the Royal
Academy would be publication; but a private view in the artist's
studio would not be publication.</p>

<p><b>Author's Nationality.</b>&mdash;It is extremely doubtful whether the
author must not at the time of first publication bear some
allegiance to the crown by virtue of nationality or residence.
If this is so in the case of books,<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> there seems to be no good
ground for saying that the statute as to sculpture<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a> was intended
to be more generous to the foreigner than that as to books.<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a></p>

<p><b>Proprietor's Name and Date.</b>&mdash;The protection given by the
Sculpture Act is conditional on the proprietor or proprietors
having caused his, her, or their name or names with the date
to be put on every sculpture before the same shall be put forth
or published.<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
</p>
<p><i>Proprietor's Name.</i><a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>&mdash;As to what will probably be a sufficient
statement of the proprietor's name, see the cases on engravings<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a>
on which also the proprietor's name is required. As to this
provision the two statutes seem to be <i>in pari materia</i> and the
cases equally applicable to both.</p>

<p><i>Date.</i>&mdash;It is not stated what date: but there can be no
reasonable doubt but that the date of first publication is intended.
The older statute governing sculptures<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> (now repealed)
required the proprietor's name and "date of publication." The
International Act, 7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. 12, in reciting the provisions
as to sculptures, runs "and by the said Acts<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> it is provided that
the name of the proprietor, with the date of first publication
thereof, is to be put on all such sculptures." It should be noticed,
however, that both statutes were then in operation and 38
Geo. III. c. 71 had not yet been repealed, so that the recitation
in 7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. 12 may apply only to the provision in 38
Geo. III. c. 71, and is not necessarily explanatory of 54 Geo. III.
c. 36. There can be no doubt, however, that the omission in
54 Geo. III. c. 56 to state what date was required was an oversight,
and everything points to its being the date of first publication
that is meant. The statutory protection begins then,
and from then the duration of the copyright is measured so
that there is strong reason for the public being apprised of the
date of first publication, while the date of making, which is the
only other conceivable date, is of no importance. When the
date affixed was a date a few days before publication, Wright, J.,
held it was immaterial, as it would only shorten the term of the
copyright.<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a></p>

<p><b>Immoral Works.</b>&mdash;Profane, libellous, or indecent works will
not be protected. There are no direct authorities in respect
of unlawful works of sculpture, but as in books,<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> paintings,<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> and
engravings<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> the general policy of the law not to take an account
between wrong-doers will apply.</p>

<p><b>Duration of Protection.</b>&mdash;Statutory protection commences on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
publication.<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> Before publication the unpublished work will be
protected at common law from any use which may be made
of it without the permission of the owner. After publication
the statutory protection alone exists and subsists for fourteen
years<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> with a further term of fourteen years if at the expiration
of the first term the person who originally made or caused the
sculpture to be made is alive and has not parted with the
copyright.<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section II.&mdash;The Owner of the Copyright.</span></h3>

<p><b>The Artist.</b>&mdash;If a work of sculpture is made by an artist on
his own behalf he becomes on publication the proprietor of
the copyright if before publication he has not assigned his
interest in the work.</p>

<p><b>The Employer.</b>&mdash;If one procures an artist to make a
work of sculpture for him the employer will be <i>ab initio</i> the
owner of the copyright without any necessity for assignment
from the artist. In order so to vest the work the employer,
it would seem, requires to take no part in the invention or
design of the work. If he causes the work to be done, he
comes within the Act. No valuable consideration need be
shown.</p>

<p><b>The Assignee.</b>&mdash;Assignment must be under seal, <i>i. e.</i> by a
deed in writing signed by the proprietor in the presence of and
attested by two or more credible witnesses.<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section III.&mdash;Infringement of the Copyright.</span></h3>

<p><b>Prohibited Acts and Remedies.</b>&mdash;The Act (54 Geo. III. c. 56)
gives to the proprietor "the sole right and property" of works
in sculpture.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
</p>
<p>The prohibited Acts are<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. Making a pirated copy.</span>
<span class="i0">2. Importing a pirated copy.</span>
<span class="i0">3. Exposing for sale or otherwise disposing of a pirated copy.</span>
<span class="i0">4. Causing any of these acts to be done.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The remedy is an action at the suit of the proprietor for<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">i.</span> Damages.</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">ii.</span> Injunction.</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">iii.</span> Costs&mdash;"a full and reasonable indemnity."<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Guilty Knowledge.</i>&mdash;Ignorance is no defence to an action in
respect of any of the prohibited Acts, even that of selling.</p>

<p><i>Limitation of Action.</i>&mdash;All actions under the Act must be
commenced within six months of the discovery of the offence
sued on.</p>

<p><i>Copying for Private Use.</i>&mdash;Either making or importing a single
copy for private use would technically be an infringement. The
prohibition is not limited to making or importing for sale, hire,
exhibition, or distribution, as in the case of paintings, &amp;c., under
25 &amp; 26 Vict. c. 68, sec. 6.</p>

<p><b>What is a Piratical Copy.</b>&mdash;A pirated copy may be "produced
by moulding or copying from or imitating in any way
any of the matters or things put forth or published under the
protection of the Act ... to the detriment, damage, or loss of
the proprietor."<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a></p>

<p>The prohibition is against "imitating in any way." This
prohibition does not seem so wide as that in 25 &amp; 26 Vict.
c. 68, which prohibits the multiplication of a painting or drawing
or the design thereof. It is more similar to the prohibition
in the Engraving Act 8 Geo. II. c. 13, viz., against engraving,
&amp;c., "or in any manner copying" a copyright print. It seems
therefore to be open to question as with engravings whether a
piece of sculpture can be infringed except by some work of art
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
which reproduces the peculiar art of the sculptor. Would a
piece of sculpture be infringed by a picture, sketch, or engraving
copying the design of the work?</p>

<p>Licence would be a defence, and it probably does not require
to be in writing. There is nothing in the Act from which the
necessity for a licence to be in writing could be implied.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

COPYRIGHT IN PAINTINGS, DRAWINGS, AND
PHOTOGRAPHS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section I.&mdash;What Works are Protected.</span></h3>

<p>The following works are protected under the Fine Arts Copyright
Act, 1862:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. Every original painting, drawing, and photograph:<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a></span>
<span class="i0">2. Not first published outside the British Dominions:<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a></span>
<span class="i0">3. The "author" of which is a British subject, or is resident
within the dominions of the crown [when the
work is made]:<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a></span>
<span class="i0">4. Which has been registered before infringement:<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a></span>
<span class="i0">5. And is innocent.<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Protection vests at the date of making, and endures for the
author's life and seven years.<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a></p>

<p>Protection is limited to the United Kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a></p>

<p><b>Every Original Painting, Drawing, and Photograph.</b>&mdash;There
is no attempt to define what is a painting, drawing, or photograph
within the meaning of the Act.<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> The substances used in the
making are no doubt immaterial, so long as the result is <i>ejusdem
generis</i> with what is ordinarily meant by a picture, drawing, or
photograph. A painting on the wall of a house would doubtless
be protected, but not a design created by grouping figures in a
<i>tableau vivant</i>.<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a></p>

<p><i>Originality</i> as an essential of protection means that there
must be something either in the design or execution of the work
which is not merely copied from some other artistic work. The
whole work need not be original. Thus the execution may be
original but not the design, as in the case of a photograph of an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
old picture;<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> or part only of the design may be original, as in
the case of the design of an old drawing added to or altered. In
so far as the work is new there will be protection, but in so far
as it is old there will be no protection.<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a></p>

<p><i>Artistic Merit.</i>&mdash;The Court will not inquire as to whether a
painting, drawing, or photograph is good, bad, or indifferent.
If it consists in the representation of some object by means of
light and shade or colour, it will suffice, and even the coarsest or
the most commonplace, or the most mechanical representation
of the commonest object would be protected so that an exact
reproduction of it, such as photography, for instance, would produce,
would be an infringement of copyright.<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> Probably there
must be a representation of some concrete object, real or imaginary.
Protection, for instance, was refused to a label for Eau de
Cologne,<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> which merely bore the legend "Johanna Maria Farina
gegenüber dem Julichs Platz," written in copperplate with
sundry dots and flourishes. It was held that any one who had a
right to sell Farina's Eau de Cologne might manufacture and
use the label, since although the label was a trade mark there
was no copyright in it. A label with anything in the nature of
a picture on it would undoubtedly be copyright, as the use to
which a work of art is put is immaterial, but it is doubtful
whether a label containing merely geometrical figures and fancy
dots and lines would be protected under the Act of 1862. Probably
it would not.</p>

<p><b>Publication outside the British Dominions.</b>&mdash;Copyright in
works of art under the Act of 1862 begins on the making thereof,
and is not dependent on publication. It is immaterial where
the work is made, whether in the British dominions or elsewhere,
and it would be as immaterial where it was first published,
or whether it was published or not, but for the provision
of the International Copyright Act, 1844. Section 19 of this Act
provides that the maker of a work of art which shall be first
published out of the British dominions shall not have copyright
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
therein otherwise than such as he may become entitled to under
the International Acts; which means that where there is no
treaty a work first published abroad is not protected at all. The
result of this section was evidently not contemplated when the
Fine Arts Act, 1862, was framed. There seems to be no doubt
that the work, wherever made, will acquire copyright immediately
on the making, but that that copyright may be lost if the
work is published abroad before it is published in the British
dominions.</p>

<p><i>Published</i>.&mdash;A painting, drawing, or photograph is probably
published when it is so exhibited as to give the public an
opportunity of viewing it. The leading case on publication of
works of art is <i>Turner</i> v. <i>Robinson</i><a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> in the Court of Chancery in
Ireland. This case was decided before 1862, and therefore
before there was any statutory copyright in paintings. The
subject-matter was a painting from which certain stereoscopic
views had been taken without the proprietor's consent. The
painting had been previously, with the consent of the proprietor,
published in the form of an engraving in a magazine, and exhibited
at the Royal Academy in London and in Manchester. It
was then exhibited with the proprietor's consent in Dublin for
the purpose of obtaining contributors to a proposed engraving,
and while so exhibited the defendant, without consent, copied
it and produced his stereoscopic photographs. The Master of
the Rolls<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> thought that the picture had never been published,
because the exhibitions to the public in the Academies and in
Dublin were on the condition that no copies should be taken,
and the engraving in the magazine was not a publication of the
picture, but only of a rough representation of it. He therefore
held that the common law right in the picture had not been lost
by publication, and that the proprietor could recover against
the taker of the stereoscopic views as against an infringer of
common law rights. The Court of Appeal in Chancery upheld
the judgment of the Master of the Rolls, but on different
grounds. They said it was unnecessary to decide whether
there had been publication in London and Manchester since,
in their opinion, the act of the defendant in taking stereoscopic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
views from the painting was a breach of faith. He was admitted
to the view in Dublin for one purpose only, <i>i. e.</i> to
become if he wished a subscriber to an engraving; but he
abused his privilege by taking a copy of the painting which
might well compete with the plaintiff's proposed engraving.
The defendant was, therefore, restrained on the ground of
breach of faith or implied contract. In his judgment the Lord
Chancellor disapproved of the view of the Master of the Rolls
that there had been no publication in London or Manchester.
He thought exhibition in the Academy, even although to a
certain extent conditional, would be sufficient publication to
vest the copyright, <i>e. g.</i> in a work of sculpture under the
statutes applicable to such works. Exhibition in a public
gallery, therefore, would be publication, but not a private view
in the artist's studio to which only a small and selected portion
of the public are invited. Whether the publication of a print
would be publication of the picture from which it was taken,
<i>quære</i>; the Master of the Rolls thought not, and on this point
the Court of Appeal neither approved nor disapproved.</p>

<p><b>Nationality or Residence of Artist</b>.&mdash;The protection of the
Act is expressly limited to the works of British subjects and of
such foreigners as are resident within the dominions of the
Crown.<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> There is no direction in the statute as to the time
when the author must possess the requisite nationality or
residence. Must it be at the time of making or at the time
of publishing, or both? It is submitted that it must be at the
time of making, since copyright in the work vests at that time,
and there may never be publication at all. There seems to be
no reason for suggesting that the date to be looked at is the date
of publication, except that the next words in the section provide
that the work may be made anywhere, and the proviso as to the
residence of the author, if applied at the date of making, means
that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. A work by a British subject may be made anywhere; but,</span>
<span class="i0">2. A work by an alien must be made within the dominions of the Crown.</span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
There does not seem to be anything absurdly contradictory in
this, and there is, on the other hand, a patent absurdity in not
being able to determine whether the author is an author within
the Act until long after the right has begun to run.</p>

<p><b>Registration.</b>&mdash;A condition precedent to protection is registration
in the book kept at the Hall of the Stationers' Company.</p>

<p><i>The Requisite Entry.</i>&mdash;There must be registered:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. Name and place of abode of the "author."</span>
<span class="i0">2. Name and place of abode of the proprietor.</span>
<span class="i0">3. Short description of the nature and subject of the
work.</span>
<span class="i2">And if desired,</span>
<span class="i0">4. A sketch outline or photograph of the work.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The wording of section 4 of the Act of 1862 providing for
compulsory registration is very confused, the requirements on
first registration being unaccountably mixed up with the requirements
on subsequent assignment.</p>

<p>On first registration whenever it takes place it is submitted
that the particulars entered should be as above.<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> The author
and proprietor may very likely be the same individual, in which
case the one name will be entered twice, once under each
description. It would probably not be sufficient merely to
enter the author's name once as author and leave it to be
implied that he is the owner. Even if the author and proprietor
are different persons, either because the author has
been employed for valuable consideration or because he has
granted an assignment, the particulars to be entered on first
registration are the same, no entry of the terms of employment
or assignment being necessary.<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> The real proprietor must be on
the register, and if the wrong person is registered as proprietor
it will not give a cause of action to join such person as co-plaintiff
with the real proprietor who is not on the register.<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a></p>

<p>As in the Literary Copyright Act, copyright in the work
exists before registration, but no action is maintainable without
registration, and under this Act even after registration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
there is no remedy in respect of infringement committed before
registration.<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a></p>

<p>It need hardly be said that the necessity of registration only
applies to an action on copyright proper, and an action will
without registration lie on breach of contract, express or
implied,<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> and probably on the common law right of an author
and his assigns in unpublished work.<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a></p>

<p>If an unauthorised copy is made before the proprietor is
registered but sold afterwards, an action for damages will lie
for the offence of selling such copies, but no action for penalties.<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a>
No action at all will lie for making.<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a></p>

<p>If an action is brought by an assignee, such assignee must
be on the register as proprietor,<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> and it will not avail to join
as co-plaintiff an unregistered assignee with the assignor who
although registered has parted with the copyright.<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> An assignee
taking from a registered assignor probably cannot sue in respect
of acts of infringement committed before the registration of the
assignment.<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> It is not necessary that the original proprietor,
whether author or employer, should have been registered,<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> but
once registration has been effected it would seem that all future
assignments must be entered on the register.<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a></p>

<p>The registration by an assignee under an assignment,
subsequent to first registration, must contain the following
particulars:<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. Date of assignment.</span>
<span class="i0">2. Names of parties to the assignment.</span>
<span class="i0">3. Name and place of abode of the assignee.</span>
<span class="i0">4. Name and place of abode of the author.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span></span>
<span class="i0">5. Short description of nature and subject of the work.</span>
<span class="i2">And if desired,</span>
<span class="i0">6. A sketch outline or photograph of the work.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The enactments of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45 (the Literary Copyright
Act) as to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. Keeping the Register Book;</span>
<span class="i0">2. Searches and certified copies therefrom;</span>
<span class="i0">3. False entries;</span>
<span class="i0">4. Application to expunge,</span>
</div></div>

<p>apply <i>mutatis mutandis</i> to registration of paintings, drawings,
and photographs.</p>

<p>The charge for making an entry is one shilling.</p>

<p><i>Name.</i>&mdash;The trading style of a firm is a sufficient registration
of the name of a proprietor.</p>

<p><i>Place of Abode.</i>&mdash;The place where a man can readily be
found on inquiry is sufficient. A business address is a "place
of abode" within the statute.</p>

<p><i>Short Description of the Nature and Subject of the Work.</i>&mdash;The
title of the work will sometimes be a sufficient description.
The following were held sufficient descriptions of Sir John
Millais' well-known pictures, viz.: "Painting in oil, 'Ordered on
Foreign Service'"; "Painting in oil, 'My First Sermon'";
"Photograph, 'My Second Sermon.'"<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> Blackburn, J., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is the object of the legislature that enough be stated to identify
the production, and that the registration must be <i>bonâ fide</i>, that a man
shall not first claim one thing and then sue for another. The description
must be such as shall earmark the subject.... The picture 'Ordered
on Foreign Service' represents an officer who is ordered abroad taking
leave of a lady, and no one can doubt that is the picture intended....
There may be a few instances in which the mere registration of the name
of the picture is not sufficient: for instance, Sir Edwin Landseer's picture
of a Newfoundland dog might possibly be insufficiently registered under
the description of 'A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society.'
So also of a bullfinch and a couple of squirrels described as 'Piper and
a Pair of Nut-crackers.' ... It would be advisable for a person proposing
to register to add a sketch or outline of the work."<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span></p></blockquote>

<p>In the learned judge's opinion deficient description although
it would not be sufficient in itself, may be made sufficient by
the addition of a photograph, sketch, or outline. It would
seem, however, that there must be a description of some kind,
and that a photograph or sketch would not by itself be sufficient.</p>

<p><b>Immoral Works.</b>&mdash;There will be no copyright in profane,
libellous, or indecent<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> works of art.</p>

<p><b>Duration of Protection.</b>&mdash;The copyright under the Fine Arts
Act endures for the term of the natural life of the "author" and
seven years after his death.<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a></p>

<p>Copyright will cease if and when any painting or drawing or
the negative of any photograph is sold by the first owner thereof
without either the express reservation in writing of such copyright
to the vendor signed by the vendee or his agent, or the
express assignment in writing of such copyright to the vendee
signed by the vendor or his agent.<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a></p>

<p>The copyright will also cease (probably) if the work is published
out of the British dominions before publication within
the dominions.<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section II.&mdash;The Owner of the Copyright.</span></h3>

<p><b>The Author.</b>&mdash;The copyright is given to "the author and his
assigns," except when the work is executed for or on behalf of
any other person for a good or valuable consideration.<a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> The
author is the actual artist whose mind has created the work.<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a>
The giving of ideas and suggestions to another is not sufficient
to constitute an author,<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> but, on the other hand, there might be
an author who had done little or nothing of the manual work
required in the execution. In <i>Nottage</i> v. <i>Jackson</i> the question of
authorship in works of art was fully discussed. Brett, M. R.,
said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"The author of a painting is the man who paints it, the author of a
drawing is the man who draws it,... of a photograph the author is the
person who effectively is as near as he can be the cause of the picture which
is produced, that is, the person who has superintended the arrangement,
who has actually formed the picture by putting the people into position
and arranging the place in which the people are to be&mdash;the man who is
the effective cause of that. Although he may only have done it by standing
in the room and giving orders about it, still it is his mind and act, as
far as anybody's mind and act are concerned, which is the effective cause
of the picture such as it is when it is produced."</p></blockquote>

<p>Cotton, L. J., in the same case, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In my opinion 'author' involves originating, making, producing, as
the inventive or master mind, the thing which is to be protected, whether
it be a drawing or a painting or a photograph.... It is not the person
who suggests the idea but the person who makes the painting or drawing
who is the author."</p></blockquote>

<p><b>The Employer.</b>&mdash;When an artistic work, protected by 25 &amp; 26
Vict. c. 68, is executed by the author for or on behalf of any
other person for a good or valuable consideration, the copyright
vests in the employer and his assigns, unless it be expressly
reserved to the author by agreement in writing signed by the
employer.<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> This provision applies to the everyday case of a
person employing and paying a painter or photographer to take
his portrait. The copyright vests in the customer.<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> The case,
however, is not always so simple. Difficult questions arise
where the artist, usually a photographer, requests the sitter,
probably an actress or athlete, to allow his portrait to be taken
on the understanding that the artist may publish and sell copies.<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a>
The sitter probably receives free copies or copies at a reduced
price. The difficulties to be solved are purely questions of fact
in each case, viz.:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. Was the portrait taken for or on behalf of some person
other than the artist?</span>
<span class="i0">2. Did the artist receive good and valuable consideration?</span>
</div></div>

<p>As a rule, where a photographer invites celebrities to sit for him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
the understanding will be that the portrait is taken on the photographer's
behalf;<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> but at the same interview some plates might
be taken on behalf of the photographer and some on behalf of
the sitter.<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> The valuable consideration received by the photographer
need not be a money payment, but may consist merely
in the right given to him to publish and sell copies.<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a></p>

<p>When a managing director of a company employed A to
make drawings for a trade catalogue, the letterpress of which he
wrote himself, it was held that he was acting merely as agent for
the company, and that as the drawings were made not on his
behalf but on behalf of the company he was not the proprietor.<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a></p>

<p><b>The Assignee.</b>&mdash;Assignment is required to be by some note
or memorandum in writing signed by the proprietor of the
copyright or his agent appointed for that purpose in writing.<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a>
Registration is not necessary to effect assignment,<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a> although the
assignee must be registered before he can sue.<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a></p>

<p>No particular words are required in an assignment,<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> but there
must be a present grant and not only an executory contract.<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a></p>

<p><i>Partial Assignment.</i>&mdash;It is doubtful whether a copyright can
be partially assigned, either limited as to a copying of a particular
kind or limited as to place or time.<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> What is called by the
parties an assignment may only amount to a licence. In <i>Lucas</i>
v. <i>Cooke</i><a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> the proprietor of the copyright in a picture granted the
following document to an engraver: "I assign to you for the
purposes of an engraving of one size the copyright of the picture
painted by Mr. E. V. Eddie, entitled "Going to Work," and being
a portrait of my daughter." Fry, J., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The result of this instrument in my view was that after the preparation
of the engraving and the registration, Mr. Lucas (the engraver)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
became the owner of the copyright of the print or engraving, and Mr.
Halford remained the owner of the copyright of the painting."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was held that the engraver, in order to succeed against a copyist,
would have to show that the alleged infringement was a
copy of his engraving, another copy of the picture itself was no
infringement of his rights. The transaction was a licence, and
probably a licensee can never sue in his own name. In one
case,<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> however, Mathew, J., held that a sole licensee for a
limited time could sue, and did not require to be registered.
The plaintiff had acquired from the proprietor of the copyright
in a picture the sole right to reproduce it in chromo for
two years. The defendants also produced a chromo of the
picture taken directly from the picture and not from the plaintiff's
chromo. Mathew, J., held that the plaintiff, as sole licensee,
was entitled to prevent any one infringing his right, and that
being a licensee and not an assignee, his name was not
required to be on the register. This is a very doubtful
decision.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section III.&mdash;Infringement.</span></h3>

<p><b>Prohibited Acts and Remedies.</b>&mdash;The right given is "the sole
and exclusive right of copying, engraving, reproducing, and
multiplying a painting or drawing and the design thereof, or
a photograph and the negative thereof by any means and of
any size."<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a></p>

<p>It is an offence for the author having parted with the copyright,
or for any other person not being the proprietor<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. To repeat, copy, colourably imitate or otherwise
multiply for sale, hire, exhibition, or distribution.</span>
<span class="i0">2. Knowingly to import into the United Kingdom, or sell,

for sale, hire, exhibition, or distribution any copy
unlawfully made.</span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span></p>

<p>And for any of the above offences an action lies at the
instance of the proprietor for<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">i.</span> Sum not exceeding £10 on each copy made or dealt
with.<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">ii.</span> Forfeiture of copies to the proprietor.<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a></span>

<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">v.</span> Injunction.<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Penalties and forfeiture of copies may also be obtained by
summary proceedings before any two justices having jurisdiction
where the party offending resides.<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a></p>

<p>It is further an offence&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">3. Innocently to import or sell, publish, let to hire, exhibit,
or distribute, or offer for sale, hire, exhibition,
or distribution any copy made without the
owner's consent.</span>
</div></div>

<p>For any of which an action lies at the instance of the proprietor
of the copyright for<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">i.</span> Damages.</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">ii.</span> Delivery up of copies,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">iii.</span> Inspection and account.<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">iv.</span> Injunction.<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>In addition to sections 6 and 11, where importing is treated
as an infringement involving penalties and damages, section 10
contains a direct prohibition against importing copies "made
contrary to the provisions of the Act," and on the declaration
of the proprietor such copies may be detained by the officers
of Customs.<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a></p>

<p><i>Cause or Procure.</i>&mdash;It is equally an offence to "cause or procure"
any of the above acts.<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> It may be sometimes difficult to
determine whether a person has "caused or procured" within
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
the meaning of the section. In <i>Bolton</i> v. <i>London Exhibitions</i><a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a>
the defendants ordered a poster for the advertisement of their
exhibition at Earl's Court; they gave the lithographer a general
idea of what was wanted, and told him to do his best. The
lithographer, in preparing the poster, infringed the copyright
in the plaintiff's photograph of a lion. It was held that as the
defendants did not authorise the reproduction of the plaintiff's
lion they had not "caused or procured" the infringement complained
of; the action against them was therefore dismissed, but
without costs, as they should have exercised more care in the
matter.</p>

<p><i>Innocent Agent.</i>&mdash;If a publisher procures a printer to strike
off copies of an infringement, the printer is liable even although
he is entirely innocent. It was argued in <i>Baschet</i> v. <i>London
Illustrated</i><a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a> that the printer was only liable if he printed for his
own use, and that if another caused or procured him to print, it
was only the person causing or procuring who was liable. It
was held that both the employers and employees were liable for
the same offence.</p>

<p><i>Unlawful Copy.</i>&mdash;If a copy is made in a foreign country in
which the proprietor's copyright is not protected, such copy is
not a copy "unlawfully made," and therefore no penalties will
attach under section 6 for knowingly importing or selling such
copy;<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> but under section 11 damages may be sued for, since
under that section it is an offence to import or sell copies made
without consent, and delivery up may be claimed under the
same section, because such copies when offered for sale become
unlawful copies although not unlawfully made.<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a> The same distinction
applies to selling or importing copies made before registration,
such copies not being "unlawfully made."<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a></p>

<p><i>Separate Offence.</i>&mdash;Each piratical copy made or dealt with, and
not only each transaction, is an offence under section 6, and involves
a separate penalty.<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> Blackburn, J., says in <i>ex parte Beal</i>:<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It would be a monstrous absurdity if a man might import a cargo of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
pirated works from France and £10 be the utmost penalty that could be
imposed. Such a state of the law would render it worth a man's while to
do wrong."<a id="FNanchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It was held in several cases<a id="FNanchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> that as <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>d. was the smallest coin
of the realm, the minimum penalty must be <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>d. for each copy.
This has now been overruled in the Court of Appeal in <i>Hildesheimer</i>
v. <i>Faulkner</i>,<a id="FNanchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> and a fraction of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>d. can be assessed as the
penalty.</p>

<p><i>Copying for Private Use</i> will probably not be actionable, since
the offence is to copy, &amp;c., for sale, hire, exhibition, or distribution.<a id="FNanchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a>
Gratuitous distribution would, however, be actionable.</p>

<p><i>Action on Breach of Contract.</i>&mdash;Although no action may lie for
infringement, either because the party aggrieved has no copyright
or is not duly registered, there may be a remedy for breach
of contract express or implied. Thus if A contract to make
copies of B's drawing, even although B has no copyright therein,
it is a breach of contract for A to make any copies other than
for the use of B.<a id="FNanchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> And again, a photographer who has been
employed by a customer to take his portrait is not justified in
striking off copies of such photograph for his own use, or selling
or exhibiting them by way of advertisement or otherwise, without
the authority of such customer express or implied, and even
although the customer is not registered as proprietor of the
photograph.<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a></p>

<p><i>Fraudulent Acts</i>.&mdash;The following acts if committed fraudulently
are rendered penal by the Act:<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. To affix any name, initials, or monogram on any
work.<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a></span>
<span class="i0">2. To sell, exhibit, &amp;c., a work bearing false name, initials,
or monogram.</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
<span class="i0">3. To represent a copy as the work of an original
"author."</span>
<span class="i0">4. To sell or publish an altered work as the unaltered
work of an original "author."</span>
</div></div>

<p>For any of these fraudulent acts the person aggrieved may
recover by action<a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">i.</span> Sum not exceeding £10 or double the full value of
the fraudulent works.</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">ii.</span> Delivery up of the fraudulent works.</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">ii.</span> Injunction.</span>
</div></div>

<p>But such penalties will not be incurred if the person whose
name or work has been fraudulently dealt with has been dead for
more than twenty years.</p>

<p><i>Limitation of Action.</i>&mdash;There is no special limit fixed by the
Act of 1862, and therefore the remedy on an offence within the
statute will not be barred for six years.<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a></p>

<p><i>Evidence.</i>&mdash;In any action for the infringement of copyright in
a picture, it will be sufficient to produce in evidence an authenticated
copy of the picture, <i>e. g.</i> a photograph with the oral
evidence of the photographer.<a id="FNanchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a></p>

<p><b>What is a Piratical Copy.</b>&mdash;<i>No Monopoly.</i>&mdash;There can be no
monopoly of the subject-matter of a painting, drawing, or photograph.
Another artist may independently represent the same
scene or object as that represented in a copyright work.<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a></p>

<p><i>What is a Copy.</i>&mdash;A piratical copy need not necessarily be an
artistic work of the same kind as the work pirated. Thus an
oil painting is infringed by a photograph of it,<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> and a photograph
may be infringed by a pencil sketch.<a id="FNanchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> An infringement
may consist of either a taking of the design or a taking of
the method of execution, or both. Thus an infringement need
not even be a kind of work which would be protected by this
Act. Although there is no direct authority, it is clear from
section 2, which gives the exclusive right to the design of the
work protected, that an engraving would be an infringement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
of a painting, drawing, or photograph, and so perhaps might a
piece of sculpture.<a id="FNanchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> Then again the design may not be copyright,
for instance, in the case of a photograph of a non-copyright
picture, and yet it would be an infringement to take a
photograph of such a photograph. That would be a taking of
the method of execution.<a id="FNanchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a></p>

<p>The infringement must be an artistic work of some kind, <i>i. e.</i>
such a work that would be protected if not under the Act of 1862,
under the Engraving Acts or Sculpture Act. In <i>Hanfstaengl</i> v.
<i>Empire Palace</i><a id="FNanchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> the Court held that the grouping of people on a
stage so as to form <i>tableaux vivants</i> was not an infringement
in the copyright of a picture thus represented.  Kay, L. J., in
his judgment, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Could it possibly have been said the <i>tableaux vivants</i> were pictures
within the sense of this Act, and does not a reproduction mean something
in which, if the original author of the painting had himself produced it, he
might have had copyright."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>General Idea may be Taken.</i>&mdash;It is not an infringement to
take merely the general idea of subject-matter and treatment
from a copyright work of art. In <i>Hanfstaengl</i> v. <i>Baines</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> the
<i>tableaux vivants</i> which were the subject of the last case cited
were sketched and reproduced in the <i>Daily Graphic</i>. It was
contended that these sketches infringed the copyright in
the pictures from which the <i>tableaux vivants</i> were taken.
The House of Lords, affirming the judgment of the Court of
Appeal, held that they did not. Lord Herschell, L. C., in giving
judgment, pointed out that the essence of the design varied
according to the nature of the picture. Sometimes it might be
principally in the grouping of the figures, sometimes in the
pose and countenances. Referring to one of the sketches complained
of, he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is no doubt a resemblance between the sketch and the photograph
from the painting. In each case a young man and a young woman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
are standing beside one another close to a stile or fence. In each case
the woman is shading her head by a parasol, and the dress of the man is
somewhat similar in the two, but the idea of a young man courting a
young woman at a country stile is of great antiquity. It has often formed
the subject of pictorial representation. This cannot be said to be the
design of the plaintiff's painting within the meaning of the Act. Much
more must be comprehended than this. There can only be a copy of
such design if the treatment of the subject be the same. Now, comparing
the sketch of the photograph from the painting, I do not think this can
be said to be the case. The faces are different, the dress especially in
the case of the woman is different, the pose is different, the attitudes are
different, the backgrounds are different, and in the case of the sketch the
foreground is wanting. In the artistic design all these things play a part,
although I do not say that a variation in one or even more of these
respects would prevent the sketch being a copy of the design. Yet, comparing
the two and considering the design of the painting as a whole, I
cannot avoid the conclusion that the sketch is not a copy of the painting
or of the design thereof, and therefore there has been no infringement."</p></blockquote>

<p>His lordship concluded by saying that such questions really
depended on the effect produced on the mind by a study of the
picture and of that which is alleged to be a copy of it. In
<i>Guggenheim</i> v. <i>Leng</i><a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> the plaintiff was the owner of the copyright
in a photograph of a football team. The defendant, without
authority, made from the photograph rough sketches of the
various individual portraits, and published them in his newspaper.
It was held not to be an infringement.</p>

<p><i>Material Part.</i>&mdash;There is no piracy of an artistic work unless
a material part of the work is taken. What amounts to a material
part must be a question of fact in each case, and it is impossible
to lay down any definite rule. In <i>Moore</i> v. <i>Clarke</i><a id="FNanchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> a horse was
taken from a copyright print and inserted in another print among
different surroundings. In the second print the horse appeared
to be going in a different direction, and the jockey on his back
was differently dressed. The judge directed the jury to consider
whether the defendant's engraving was substantially a copy of
the plaintiff's, and the jury came to the conclusion that it was
not. In <i>Brooks</i> v. <i>Religious Tract Society</i><a id="FNanchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> a collie dog, identical
in expression, attitude, and position, was, together with a wall in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
the background and a table, taken from a copyright picture and
inserted in a woodcut. The woodcut differed from the picture
in that the figure of a child was omitted, and in its place two
cats and a tortoise and other details were inserted. Romer, J.,
held that there was a piracy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was not only the dog that was taken, but also the feeling and
artistic character of the plaintiff's work.... If a person were to take an
historical picture, and take out of it the principal figure, and reproduce
that figure without the other surroundings, that would be an infringement.
The present case was a stronger case, because the defendants had not
only taken the principal figure of a dog, but copied as well the sentiment
of the picture."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Indirect Taking.</i>&mdash;It is equally an infringement, although the
copying is indirect.<a id="FNanchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> Thus, for instance, the photograph of an
engraving may infringe the copyright of the picture from which
it is taken.<a id="FNanchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a></p>

<p><i>Guilty Knowledge.</i>&mdash;It is no defence to say that the taking
was an innocent one and unintentional.<a id="FNanchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> In the case of a claim
for penalties in respect of importing or selling piratical copies,
knowledge of infringement must necessarily be proved, but in
no other case. But the question of intention cannot always be
wholly disregarded, as it may guide the Court in determining
whether the alleged infringement is a copy or not.<a id="FNanchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a></p>

<p><i>Replicas.</i>&mdash;It is an infringement of the proprietor's right for
an author who has parted with his copyright to make a replica
of the work; but if he has made replicas before selling his copyright
it would be no infringement to sell these replicas. <i>Quære</i>
whether it would be an infringement after selling his copyright
in the original work to take photographs or engravings of the
replicas; probably it would.</p>

<p><i>Licence a Defence.</i>&mdash;Licence must be in writing, signed by the
proprietor of copyright or by his agent authorised in writing;<a id="FNanchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a>
but probably an oral consent would be a good defence.<a id="FNanchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
</p>
<p>An assignee is not bound by a licence granted by the assignor
before the assignment, unless he has notice of it.<a id="FNanchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a></p>

<p>The licensee will be kept strictly within the limits of his
licence. When a licence was granted to reproduce a photograph
in one magazine, it was held an infringement of copyright to reproduce
it in another, and the contention that there was a custom
in the publishing trade allowing this to be done on tender of
payment was characterised as ridiculous.<a id="FNanchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

COLONIAL COPYRIGHT</h2>

<p>Every British Possession has the power to legislate independently
as regards the protection within its own territory of
literary or artistic works first produced therein.<a id="FNanchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> In respect of
such works they may either limit or extend the protection
afforded by the Imperial Acts. Most of our larger colonies have
local Acts.<a id="FNanchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> Some of the colonies<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> have, for instance, created a
copyright in the news contained in foreign telegrams, a monopoly
unknown under the Imperial Acts. It is not proposed here to
deal with the colonial local Acts. They are of interest only in
the various colonies themselves. This chapter will be restricted
to the rights of a work published in one part of the British
dominions to receive protection in any other part of the British
dominions. This is controlled by the Imperial Copyright
Acts, which extend since 1886 to every British Possession, and
protect works published anywhere therein apart from any local
legislation.</p>

<p><b>Books.</b>&mdash;Before 1886, the Copyright Act, 1842, although it
applied to the whole of the British dominions, only protected
those books which were first published in the United Kingdom.
A book, therefore, published first, say in Canada or Australia,
received no copyright protection except by local legislation, if
any, within the territory of the particular colony where it was
first published.</p>

<p>A book first published in the United Kingdom was protected
in every British colony, not only against copying but against
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
the importation of reprints. The smaller and poorer colonies
found this a considerable grievance. They alleged that they
were unable to afford the price of English books, and that
as they were prohibited from importing foreign reprints and
had little or no contemporary literature of their own, they
were reduced to reading the classics or nothing at all. The
Colonial Copyright Act, 1847,<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> was passed to give them relief.
It enacts that when reasonable protection to the British author
shall be provided in any British possession by the legislature
of such possession, Her Majesty may, by Order in Council,
declare that so long as such protecting provision shall be in
force all Acts prohibiting the importation or sale or hire of
foreign copies shall be in respect of such possession suspended.
Altogether twenty colonies<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> have taken advantage of this Act.
It has been found, however, that the protecting provisions are of
little value, and that the duties which are supposed to be levied
on foreign reprints for the benefit of the British author are
continually evaded, and the colonies under the Foreign Reprints
Act are overrun with foreign reprints of popular books which,
coming in practically free of duty, make the authors' copyright
in such colonies absolutely valueless.</p>

<p>Books first published in the colonies received Imperial
protection in 1886, when the International Copyright Act<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> of
that year was passed. It enacts that the Copyright Acts shall
apply to a literary or artistic work first produced in a British
Possession in like manner as they apply to a work first produced
in the United Kingdom,<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> with a proviso, firstly, that the enactments
as to registration shall not apply if the law of the Possession
in question provides for registration; and, secondly, that no
delivery of copies shall be required. There is also a provision
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
for evidence of colonial copyright by certified extract from the
colonial register.</p>

<p><i>Canada</i> came under the Foreign Reprints Act, and, as a
result, was so inundated with cheap reprints from the United
States that the Canadian publishers, in 1875, obtained a local
Act for their protection.<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a> This Act enacts that works of which
the copyright has been granted and is subsisting in the United
Kingdom, and copyright of which is not secured or subsisting
in Canada under any Canadian or provincial Act, shall, upon
being printed and published or reprinted and republished in
Canada, be entitled to copyright under the Canadian Act.<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> It
prohibits <i>inter alia</i> copying and importation of foreign copies,
but nothing in the Act is to be held to prohibit the importation
from the United Kingdom of copies of such works legally printed
there. The Canadian Act is confirmed by an Imperial Act, the
Canada Copyright Act, 1875,<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> and this enacts that the Canadian
copies of a British book may not be imported into the United
Kingdom without the author's consent.</p>

<p>Although Canada came under the Foreign Reprints Act, 1847,<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a>
and in accordance therewith imposed duties on foreign reprints
for the benefit of the owner of the copyright, the collection of
those duties has now been abandoned by the Tariff Customs
Act (Canada), 1894,<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> the result of which is that as regards
Canada the provisions of the Imperial Copyright Act, 1842,<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a>
section 17, are revived and the importation of foreign copies of
works having an Imperial copyright is again prohibited.<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> The
same result will occur in other colonies which may by statute
abandon their enactments for the collection of authors'
duties.</p>

<p>The Canadian Legislature has recently passed a Copyright
Act<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> purporting to affect the importation into Canada of books
published under an Imperial Copyright. The Act provides that
if a book has acquired Imperial Copyright by first publication in
the British dominions outside Canada, and a licence has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
granted for its reproduction in Canada, the Canadian Minister of
Agriculture may prohibit the importation into Canada of any
copies of such book printed out of Canada and imported without
the licensee's consent.</p>

<p>I think it is doubtful whether the last-mentioned Act is not
<i>ultra vires</i> of the Canadian Legislature. The Canadians have,
since the British North American Act, 1867, claimed that they
have the exclusive power of legislating in respect of and
regulating copyright within the Dominion of Canada. This
claim, however, has not been recognised in the Canadian courts.
In <i>Smiles</i> v. <i>Belford</i><a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> a book was copyrighted in England, but not
under the local Act of 1875 in Canada. An action was brought
by the proprietor to restrain a reprint of the book in Canada.
The defendants pleaded that the book was not protected in
Canada since it was not copyrighted under the local Act. They
argued that the British North American Act, in giving to the
Parliament of Canada "exclusive legislative authority" in certain
matters, including copyrights, excluded the operation of the
Imperial Acts in Canada. They further argued that the confirmation
of the Canadian Copyright Act, 1875, by the Imperial
Parliament impliedly repealed the Imperial Copyright Act of
1842 in so far as it extended to Canada. The Court held that
neither of these arguments was sound. With reference to the
argument on the British North American Act, Burton, J. A., in
the Court of Appeal, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is clear, I think, that all the Imperial Act intended to effect was
to place the right of dealing with colonial copyright within the Dominion
under the exclusive control of the Parliament of Canada, as distinguished
from the provincial legislatures.... I entirely concur with the learned
Vice-Chancellor in the opinion he has expressed that under that Act no
greater powers were conferred upon the Parliament of the Dominion to
deal with this subject than had been previously enjoyed by the local
legislatures."</p></blockquote>

<p>As regards the Imperial Act confirming the Canada Copyright
Act, 1875, the Court held that it was passed merely to
resolve doubts which would otherwise have arisen as to whether
the Canada Copyright Act was not repugnant to the provisions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
of the Foreign Reprints Act, 1847, and the Order in Council
thereunder applicable to Canada. Burton, J. A., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is scarcely reasonable to suppose that if the Imperial Parliament
had thought fit to accept the Canadian enactment as a substitute for the
5 &amp; 6 Vict. they would not have repealed it so far as it affected Canada
in express terms, or that when stating a reason for Imperial legislation
they would have confined themselves to a reference to the Order in
Council, which dealt only with a portion of the prohibition referred to in
that statute. I am of opinion, therefore, that they have stated the only
reason which rendered it expedient to seek a confirmation of the Provisional
Act, and that it was intended to preserve intact so much of the
Imperial Act as prohibits the printing of a British copyright work in
Canada, but giving to the author a further right on certain conditions of
securing a Canadian copyright and thus preventing the importation into
Canada of foreign reprints."</p></blockquote>

<p>For some considerable time before the passing of the
Canadian Act of 1900, the Canadians were negotiating for a
clause in the Copyright Bill in this country enabling them to
pass a similar provision to that which they have now passed
without Imperial sanction. A clause was inserted in Lord
Monkswell's Literary Copyright Bill, 1900, proposing to give to
all the colonies such a power of protecting licensees. The
Canadians, however, impatient of the delay in copyright reform
in this country, passed their own Act without waiting to obtain
authority. It would certainly be satisfactory to see it confirmed
by an Imperial statute.</p>

<p><i>Summary of Provisions in respect of Books.</i>&mdash;The result of
the various enactments with reference to the colonies is that,
as regards copying, every book first published in any part of
the British dominions is protected in every other part of the
British dominions. The book must be duly registered either
in the colony or dependency where it is produced, or, if such
colony or dependency does not provide a proper system of
registration, at Stationers' Hall in London. The protection
within the colony in which a book is first produced depends
on local legislation if such overrides the Imperial legislation.
As to importation of copies, the result is not so simple, but it
may be summarised thus:</p>

<p>If a book has been first published anywhere within the
British dominions, the following prohibitions apply:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span></p>

<p>I. <i>The United Kingdom.</i>&mdash;There shall not be imported into,
or sold in, without the consent in writing of the owner of the
copyright&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Copies printed outside the British dominions.<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Copies printed in Canada under the Canadian Act.<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>II. <i>Canada.</i>&mdash;If the book has been printed and published, or
reprinted and republished,<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> and registered in Canada, there shall
not be imported into, or sold in, without the consent in writing
of the owner of the copyright&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="hang">Copies printed outside Canada<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> unless legally printed
in the United Kingdom under an Imperial copyright
existing prior to the acquirement of a Canadian local
copyright.<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If a book has acquired Imperial copyright by first publication
within the British dominions outside Canada, and the owner of
the copyright has granted a licence to reproduce it in Canada,
there shall not be imported (if the Minister of Agriculture so
order) without the consent in writing of the Canadian licensee&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Copies printed outside Canada.<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other cases these shall not be imported or sold without
the written consent of the owner of the copyright&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Copies printed outside the British dominions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>III. <i>Colonies under the Act of 1847 other than Canada.</i>&mdash;There
is no prohibition except the nominal import duty on copies
printed outside the British dominions.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Other Colonies.</i>&mdash;There shall not be imported into or sold
in without the consent in writing of the owner of the copyright&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Copies printed outside the British dominions.<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Artistic Works.</b>&mdash;We have seen that since the International
Copyright Act, 1886, there is complete protection throughout
the whole of the British dominions for books first published
anywhere therein. It was evidently intended that artistic works
should be placed on the same footing, but unfortunately the
distinction between the literary and artistic Acts was overlooked.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
The Copyright Act, 1842, protected books published in the
United Kingdom, but expressly extended the protection to the
whole of the British dominions. None of the artistic copyright
Acts extend their protection beyond the United Kingdom. The
Engraving Acts expressly limit their protection to the United
Kingdom;<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> the Paintings, Drawings, and Photographs Act expressly
limits its remedies to the United Kingdom;<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> and the
Sculpture Act is silent as to the extent of its protection.<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> The
result seems to be that although since 1886 all works of art first
published anywhere throughout the British dominions will be
protected by Imperial legislation, that protection extends no
further than the United Kingdom. This has been decided by
a divisional Court in Canada in respect of the Paintings, Drawings,
and Photographs Act, 1862.<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> The decision will apply
<i>a fortiori</i> to engravings. Sculptures may be different, in that
there is no express limit contained in the Sculptures Act; but
probably a limitation of protection to the United Kingdom
will be implied. The result is that artistic works are only
protected in the Colonies and dependencies under local
legislation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT</h2>

<p><b>Works first produced in His Majesty's Dominions</b> are protected
in those foreign countries with which there is a treaty for the
mutual protection of literary and artistic rights. These countries
are the signatories of the Berne Convention,<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a> and Austria-Hungary,
with which there is a separate treaty on similar lines.
Generally it may be presumed that each of these countries has
by domestic legislation given full effect to the international
agreement, and that all works which are protected in this
country, and would have been protected if first produced in
the foreign country in question, will receive the same protection
there as would be accorded to a work first produced
in such foreign country. The protection, however, must be
sought in the foreign country and not here. The Courts of
this country will not grant any redress for the infringement of
a British author's copyright in a foreign State, even although
such infringement be perpetrated by a British subject resident
in England.<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a></p>

<p><b>Works first produced in foreign countries with which this
country has no treaty</b> are in no way protected from infringement
in the United Kingdom, unless they are produced within
His Majesty's dominions simultaneously with their production
elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a></p>

<p><b>Works first produced in foreign countries with which this
country has a treaty</b> are protected from infringement in His
Majesty's dominions by the domestic legislation of the United
Kingdom.</p>

<p>Before December 6, 1887, foreign works were protected by
virtue of the International Copyright Acts of 1844, 1852, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
1875, and numerous Orders in Council, now revoked, giving effect
to treaties with various foreign States. As the subsequent
provisions under the International Copyright Act, 1886, are
retrospective, it is unnecessary to examine the old law in any
detail. On one important point, however, it will be necessary
to mention some of the provisions of the International Copyright
Acts which were applicable before December 6, 1887,
since the subsequent legislation, in giving protection to works
which were produced before that date and were then unprotected,
enacts that its retrospective effect shall not prejudice
rights and interests lawfully acquired before it came into
operation. The law before 1887 has to be examined to determine
what these rights and interests are.</p>

<p>Since December 6, 1887, the rights of foreign authors in His
Majesty's dominions have depended on the provisions of the
International Copyright Acts of 1844, 1852, 1875, and 1886, the
Berne Convention of 1887, and an Order in Council of November
28, 1887. To these are now added the Additional Act of
Paris, 1896, and an Order in Council of March 7, 1898. These
may now all be read together, and apply to all foreign works
first produced in the countries to which they are applicable.
It should be mentioned here that Austria-Hungary has a convention
of its own, and in dealing with works produced there
that convention and the Orders in Council giving it effect must
be substituted for the Berne Convention and Additional Act of
Paris and the Orders in Council above mentioned. Norway
has not become a signatory of the Additional Act of Paris, and
therefore in dealing with works produced there the Berne
Convention must be read as unmodified by the Additional Act.</p>

<p>It is proposed to deal here in detail with the provisions of
the Acts, Orders in Council, and treaties as they apply to the
majority of the foreign countries, <i>i. e.</i> those which are signatories
of the Berne Convention and the Additional Act of Paris.
As regards Norway and Austria-Hungary the law differs very
slightly. The law applicable to Norway can easily be ascertained

Act. The law applicable to Austria-Hungary is almost identical,
except that it affords protection in the United Kingdom and all

<p><b>What Foreign Works are entitled to Protection.</b>&mdash;Those
works are protected which are first produced in any of the
foreign countries of the Union, and which&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(<i>a</i>) Are protected by the law of the country of origin, and:</span>
<span class="i0">(<i>b</i>) Would have been protected in the United Kingdom
if first produced in the United Kingdom.</span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Produced.</i>&mdash;"Produced" means, as the case requires, published
or made, or performed, or represented,<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> or, in other words, the
act which is deemed to vest the author or publisher of the work
with exclusive rights of reproduction or publication. Thus in
the United Kingdom a book or an engraving or sculpture is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
produced when it is first published. A painting is produced
when it is made. A musical or dramatic work as regards the
performing right is probably produced<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> when it is first performed
or represented. But it would seem that, in considering when a
work is produced, the law of the foreign country or countries in
question must first be inquired into, and it will be considered to
be produced in the country where an act is done which first
invests it with protection in the nature of copyright.</p>

<p>If a work is produced simultaneously in two or more countries
of the Union, it is deemed to be first produced in that country
where the term of copyright accorded to it is shortest. And if
a work is produced simultaneously in His Majesty's dominions
and in one or more of the foreign countries of the Union, and
according to the above rule is deemed to be first produced in a
foreign country, it will be protected under the International Acts
and not under the Copyright Acts applicable to works first produced
in the United Kingdom, and <i>vice versâ</i>. If a work is
produced simultaneously in a foreign country not within the
Union and in a foreign country within it, it would no doubt be
deemed to be first produced in the foreign country within the
Union, although there is no legislative enactment to this effect.</p>

<p><i>Character of Work.</i>&mdash;In order to obtain protection in this
country, a foreign work must be such as is protected in the
country of origin.<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> In each case, therefore, it is necessary to
inquire into the laws of the country where the work is deemed
to have been first produced.<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a></p>

<p>The work must also be such as would have obtained protection
if first produced in the United Kingdom,<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> and it is therefore
necessary in each case to inquire also into the law of this
country.<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a></p>

<p><i>Unpublished Works.</i>&mdash;Unpublished works of foreign authors
are expressly included in the convention as works entitled to
protection.<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> If, therefore, they are protected in the country of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
origin, and would be protected if they had been the works of
British authors, they are entitled to protection within His
Majesty's dominions. In the case of unpublished works the
country to which the author belongs is considered the country
of origin.<a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a></p>

<p><i>Special Provisions</i>.&mdash;There is also express stipulation in the
conventions as to the inclusion of the following works:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Posthumous works:<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Authorised translations (to be protected as original works):<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Photographic works and works produced by an analogous process:<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Choregraphic works.<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p><b>Works produced in Foreign Countries before December 6,
1887.</b>&mdash;As is explained above the international treaties and
domestic legislation in this country are retrospective, and apply
to all works whenever produced. The International Act, 1886,
sec. 6 (1),<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> provides that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When an Order in Council is made under the International Copyright
Acts with respect to any foreign country, the author and publisher
of any literary or artistic work first produced before the date at which such
order comes into operation, shall be entitled to the same rights and
remedies as if the said Acts and this Act and the said Order had applied
to the said foreign country at the date of the said production."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Berne Convention, article 14, provides that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The present convention applies to all works which at the moment of
its coming into force have not yet fallen into the public domain in the
country of origin."<a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It was suggested that these retrospective provisions only
applied to works produced between the date of the Act of 1886
and December 6, 1887, <i>i. e.</i> the date at which the Order in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Council of November 28, 1887, came into operation.<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> Charles,
J., however, refused to accept such a construction, and said that
he felt no doubt that section 6 of the International Copyright
Act, 1886, applied to all literary and artistic works produced
before the date at which the Order in Council came into operation,
whether they were produced before or after the passing of
the Act.<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a></p>

<p>In <i>Lauri</i> v. <i>Renad</i><a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> it was held by the Court of Appeal that
when under the older law a right of translation in this country
had existed, and had expired by lapse of time, the Act of 1886
would not operate to revive such a right, even although the rights
of reproduction and translation still subsisted in the country of
origin. This is generally thought to be an unsound decision, as
the proper test in such cases is whether the right has fallen into
the public domain, not in this country but in the country of
origin.</p>

<p><b>Formalities required in case of Foreign Works.&mdash;</b></p>

<p><i>In the Country of Origin</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All such formalities must be observed as are necessary
to entitle to protection under the domestic law of
such country.<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>In the United Kingdom</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. Registration or delivery of copies to the libraries is
unnecessary.<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a></span>
<span class="i0">2. Musical works must bear a notice of reservation on
each authorised copy, otherwise the performing
right will be lost.<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a></span>
<span class="i0">3. Whether other formalities such as name and date
of publication on an engraving,<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> name and date on
sculpture,<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> are necessary <i>quære</i>.</span>
</div></div>

<p>Before 1886 registration and delivery of copies of a foreign
work was required by the Act of 1844<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> and various Orders in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
Council in pursuance thereof. The Act of 1886, however,
enacts<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> that the provisions of the Act of 1844 as to registration
and delivery shall not apply to works produced in a foreign
country except in so far as provided by the Order in Council
referring thereto. The Order in Council of 1887<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> makes no
provision as to registration and delivery, and revokes all the
previous Orders in Council which did. In <i>Fishburn</i> v. <i>Hollingshead</i><a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a>
the question came before the Court whether since 1886
any registration or delivery was necessary. Stirling, J., held that
although none of the formalities prescribed by the International
Copyright Act of 1844<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> need be observed, yet a foreign work
must comply with the provisions of the Copyright Acts as to
registration and delivery applicable to works first produced in
this country. His <i>ratio decidendi</i> was that a foreign work was
only entitled to the protection afforded to natives,<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a> and the Act
of 1844<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> provided that all and singular the enactments of the
Copyright Acts in this country should apply to foreign works in
such and the same manner as if such works were published in the
United Kingdom. Charles, J., in <i>Hanfstaengl</i> v. <i>Holloway</i><a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> differed
from this view, and finally the Court of Appeal in <i>Hanfstaengl</i> v.
<i>American Tobacco Company</i><a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> held that no registration in this
country was necessary. The ground of this decision is that the
enactments of 1844 as to registration of foreign works superseded
the enactments of 1842, and when the provisions of 1844
were repealed the provisions of 1842 did not revive. This
reasoning, which appears to be undoubtedly sound, applies
equally to the provisions as to delivery of copies. It does not,
however, apply to the question whether such formalities as the
name and date of publication on an engraving are necessary.
At present the position seems to be this. The reasoning of
Stirling, J., in <i>Fishburn</i> v. <i>Hollingshead</i><a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> equally applies to the
formalities as to name and date on engravings and sculpture as it
does to registration and delivery. The judgment of Stirling, J.,
was overruled in <i>Hanfstaengl</i> v. <i>American Tobacco Company</i><a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a> in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
the Court of Appeal, but on grounds which do not apply to these
formalities. As to them, therefore, the judgment of Stirling, J.,
stands. It is very doubtful whether this is the correct view of the
law, but it is submitted that until <i>Fishburn</i> v. <i>Hollingshead</i><a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> is
further overruled the law is that formalities under heading 3
<i>supra</i> are necessary. In <i>Avanzo</i> v. <i>Mudie</i><a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> it was held that a
foreign print could not claim copyright under 7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. 12,
unless the date and name were engraved thereon as required by
8 Geo. II. c. 13. Mr. Scrutton, whose opinion in these matters
carries great weight, thinks that these formalities are not required.<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a>
As a matter of expediency they should always be observed where
practicable.</p>

<p><b>Who are entitled to sue in respect of a Foreign Work.</b>&mdash;The
author of a foreign work or his assignee is probably entitled to
sue in the case of all foreign works which are protected in
this country.<a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a></p>

<p>The publisher of a foreign work published anonymously or
pseudonymously is entitled to sue if his name is indicated on
the work.<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a></p>

<p><b>Evidence of Title.</b>&mdash;Where the name of the author is indicated
on a foreign work or in the case of an anonymous or
pseudonymous work the name of the publisher, such author or
publisher is, in the absence of proof that he is disentitled,
entitled to sue in respect of such foreign work.<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a></p>

<p>An extract from a register, or a certificate or other document
authenticated by the official seal or signature of a minister
of state of the foreign country of origin, or of a British diplomatic
or consular officer, lawfully acting in such foreign country,
is admitted as <i>primâ facie</i> evidence of the owner of the
copyright.<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a></p>

<p><b>Protection afforded to Foreign Works.</b>&mdash;Generally a foreign
work is accorded&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. The same right of copyright and during the same period
as if the work had been first produced in the United
Kingdom:<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> but</span>
<span class="i0">2. No greater right or longer term of protection than it
enjoys in the country of origin.<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Section 10 of the International Copyright Act, 1844,<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a> provides
that all copies of foreign books in which there is copyright
under the International Acts, if printed or reprinted in any
foreign country <i>except the country of origin</i>, shall not be imported
into the British dominions without the consent of the proprietor.
It has been held,<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a> however, that this section does not supply a
complete code as to the importation of copies of a foreign book,
and that copies printed in the country of origin will also be
prohibited in the same way as if the book had been first published
in the United Kingdom. Section 3 of the International
Copyright Act, 1844, applies to foreign works, <i>inter alia</i>, the
provisions 5 &amp; 6 Vict., sections 15 and 17, which prohibit the
importation of any copies printed outside the British dominions.
Section 10 was held not to curtail the general application in
section 3 of the provisions of the Copyright Act, 1842, to
foreign books.</p>

<p>As to certain foreign works which are dealt with below, there
is express provision in the International legislation which results
in giving such foreign works a narrower right or shorter term
than they would have if first published in this country. Where
there is no express limitation, the above general rules apply.
The law of both the country of origin and of the United Kingdom
must be examined, and the right given will be limited according
to the law which affords least protection. Where, however,
according to this rule there is a right, the Courts here will give
the same remedies as they would extend to the author of a
work first published in the United Kingdom. Thus in <i>Baschet</i> v.
<i>London Illustrated Standard</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> Kekewich, J., refused to consider
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
whether a French Court would or would not award penalties for
infringement.</p>

<p><i>Works published before December 6, 1887</i>, are protected,
except in so far as such protection may prejudice rights or
interests arising from or in connection with works lawfully
produced before, and subsisting and valuable at, that date.<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a></p>

<p>This limitation is introduced by the retrospective section of
the Act of 1886, which enacts that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Where any person has before the date of the publication of an Order
in Council lawfully produced any work in the United Kingdom, nothing
in this section shall diminish or prejudice any rights or interests arising from,
or in connection with, such production which are subsisting and valuable
at the said date."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following are some of the classes of literary or artistic
works which were not protected before 1886 but to which the
retrospective section and its saving clause applies:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">i.</span> Works not registered in this country under the International
Copyright Act, 1844, section 6.<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">ii.</span> Works which had not acquired the translating right
under the International Copyright Act, 1852, sections 2, 4, 8.</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">iii.</span> Dramatic works, as to the liberty to make fair imitations
or adaptations to the English stage under the
International Copyright Act, 1852, section 6.</span>
</div></div>

<p>"Lawfully Produced" means that the work has been produced
without contravening any right existing at the date of its
production.<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a></p>

<p>"Rights" and "Interests" are to be distinguished, the latter
word bearing a wider interpretation than the former. Right does
not mean the right to reproduce in common with all mankind,
but right in the strict legal sense of the term under the English
Copyright Acts, <i>i. e.</i> an exclusive right of property.</p>

<p>When any capital has been embarked in the production of a
work, and the publisher depends on the sale of copies in stock
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
or on the proceeds of a future edition to recoup himself for
his outlay, there is clearly an interest although there may be
no right. Where a bandmaster had purchased a copy of a
French musical composition and instructed his band to perform
it, he was held to have such an interest as would entitle him to
continue performing it after the French composer had acquired
protection under the Act of 1886.<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> Even where no capital has
been embarked, if the publisher has a special interest as distinct
from the rest of the public in the reproduction of the work, he
has an interest within the meaning of the section.<a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> Thus where
a firm had adopted a German picture as a trade mark for their
candles, they were held to have such an interest in the reproduction
as would constitute a good defence to an action for
infringement of copyright acquired under the retrospective
operation of the Act of 1886.<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a> It has been suggested that not
only the interests of the lawful producer will be safeguarded, but
also interests arising in a third person from or in connection
with such production, and this seems to be sound.<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a></p>

<p><i>Translating Right</i> expires if not exercised within ten years.</p>

<p>The exclusive right of translation is expressly given to the
foreign author by the Act of 1886 and the Additional Act of
Paris for the full term of his copyright in the original work, but
if an authorised translation in the English language is not published
after the expiration of ten years next after the end of the
year in which the work was first produced the translating right
of the author shall cease.<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> If a book is published in numbers,
the ten years run from the date of publication of the last part.<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a>
When a book is composed of a number of volumes, each volume
is considered as a separate work.<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> A translation in order to
preserve the translating right must be full and substantial.<a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> A
translation might be such as, if made without the consent of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
author, would constitute a piracy, and yet not be such a translation
as is required by the Act&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What is required is that the English people should have the opportunity
of knowing the foreign work as accurately as it is possible to know
a foreign work by the medium of a version in English."<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Articles in Newspapers and Periodicals.</i><a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a>&mdash;Articles, not being
serial stories or tales, appearing in a newspaper or periodical in
a foreign country, may be republished or translated in a newspaper
or periodical in this country without the consent of the
owner of the copyright, provided&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(<i>a</i>) In the case of articles of political discussion, the news
of the day, or miscellaneous information, the source
from which the same is taken be acknowledged.</span>

<span class="i0">(<i>b</i>) In the case of articles relating to any other subject,
the source from which the same is taken be acknowledged,
and the author has not signified his intention
in a conspicuous part of the newspaper or periodical
of preserving the copyright and right of translation.</span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Photographic Works.</i>&mdash;The Additional Act of Paris runs as
follows: "It is understood that an authorised photograph of a
work of art shall enjoy legal protection in all the countries of
the Union, as contemplated by the Berne Convention, and by
the present Additional Act, for the same period as the principal
right of reproduction of the work itself subsists, and within the
limits of private arrangements between those who have legal
rights."<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a></p>

<p>It would seem, therefore, that photographs of protected
works of art are not protected as original works, and that, whenever
produced, their protection stands and falls with the right
in the original work. Other photographs, including photographs
of unprotected works of art, are protected as original works.</p>

<p><i>Performing Right in Dramatic or Dramatic Musical Works.</i>&mdash;Exclusive
performing right in dramatic or dramatico-musical
works subsists during the existence of the exclusive right of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
translation. If the translating right is allowed to fall into the
public domain by non-exercise within ten years, the performing
right falls with it.<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a></p>

<p>There is not now as formerly any right in the public to make
fair imitations or adaptations to the English stage.<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a></p>

<p><i>Express Provision as to Particular Kinds of Infringement.</i>&mdash;The
Berne Convention, article 8, provides that the question of the
right of extract is to be decided by the legislation of the different
countries of the Union, or by special arrangement between them.
There is no special arrangement as to this with the United
Kingdom, therefore the law as to extract and quotation applicable
to works produced in this country applies.</p>

<p>Article 10 of the Berne Convention enacts that indirect
appropriations such as adaptations and arrangements are included
among illicit reproductions when they do not bear the
character of original work. Here also, therefore, the law is
similar to that applicable to works produced in this country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

COMMON LAW</h2>

<p>As to works which have been published within the meaning of
the Copyright Acts, the common law affords no protection in the
nature of copyright, that is to say, as regards the exclusive right
of reproduction, the author must rely entirely on the statutes.
There is no copyright at common law after the expiration of the
period prescribed by statute,<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a> neither is there any greater right
during that period than the statute gives.<a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a> Common law
remedies, however, may be applied when the statute gives a
right without a sufficient remedy.<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> But apart altogether from
rights in the nature of copyright, the principles of common law
and equity do apply to both published and unpublished works
to prevent or to remedy the consequences of fraud or breach
of contract.</p>

<p>As to works which have been composed<a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> but have not been
published, the common law affords protection to the author
against reproduction or interference of any kind.<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">[1109]</a></p>

<p>The rights and remedies at common law are perpetual, and
are neither limited in duration nor as regards the time within
which action must be brought, except in so far as the general
rules of equity as to acquiescence and delay or the statutes of
limitation may be applicable.</p>

<p><b>Title: Passing off.</b>&mdash;<i>No Copyright in Title.</i>&mdash;There is no copyright
in a title consisting, as a title usually does, of only a few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
words. Thus <i>Belgravia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">[1110]</a> <i>Sporting Life</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a> "Splendid Misery,"<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> <i>The
Licensed Victuallers' Mirror</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a> and "The Post Office Directory,"<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a>
have all been decided not to be the subject of copyright. In two
decisions "The Birthday Scripture Text-Book"<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> and "Trial and
Triumph"<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">[1116]</a> (as the title of a novel) were protected on the ground
of copyright in title, but since <i>Dicks</i> v. <i>Yates</i><a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">[1117]</a> in which these two
decisions were cited, and in so far as they were based on a claim
of copyright in title, disapproved, no such claim could be entertained,
and the exclusive user of a title will only be protected on
the general principles of common law and equity which prevent
one man passing off his wares as those of another man. As was
pointed out by Jessel, M. R., in <i>Dicks</i> v. <i>Yates</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a> it is conceivable
that there might be a title in which there was copyright; for
instance, if it was extremely long and elaborate, but since <i>Dicks</i>
v. <i>Yates</i> there is no case in the books where a title has been
protected on the ground of copyright.</p>

<p><i>Whether Protection is based on a Right of Property in the Title.</i>&mdash;The
great bulk of authority is to the effect that the right to prevent
others passing off their literary works under the same or a
similar title does depend on a right of property in the title as
applied to a particular class of work, which right can only be
acquired by user.<a id="FNanchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> This right is regarded as a chattel interest
capable of assignment,<a id="FNanchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> and may be a partnership asset.<a id="FNanchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">[1121]</a> In
<i>Walter</i> v. <i>Emmott</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">[1122]</a> however, Cotton and Bowen, L.JJ., expressed
a strong opinion that the right to prevent a deceitful use
of title was not founded on a right of property in the title, but
on the ground of deceit alone. It is submitted that the plaintiff
in an action of this kind need not prove deceit on the part of
the defendant, and that the right is strictly a proprietary right
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
which must have been acquired by user before the Court will
intervene.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge of Existence and Value on part of the Public.</i>&mdash;This
is necessary before an author or proprietor of a literary or
artistic work can acquire a right to the exclusive use of a title
in connexion with works of a certain class. It is not sufficient
that the title of a proposed book or magazine has been extensively
advertised or that it has been registered, even although
great expenditure has been incurred in the preparation and
advertisement.<a id="FNanchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">[1123]</a> Any one, it would seem, can seize the opportunity
of another's advertisements and bring out a similar book
under the same or a similar title, either before the publication of
that other's book or immediately after its publication, and before
it became known to the public as an actually existing publication
which they have had an opportunity of reading and forming an
opinion of on its merits. The sale of a few copies only will not
establish a common law right in title.<a id="FNanchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">[1124]</a> Not only must the work
be well known to the public, but it must also be distinctively
known under the title in which a proprietary right is claimed.<a id="FNanchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a></p>

<p>No right can be acquired by attaching an original title to an
old work in which the publisher has no proprietary right. In
<i>Talbot</i> v. <i>Judges</i><a id="FNanchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">[1126]</a> the plaintiffs published a work in which they
had no copyright of any kind under a title of their own
invention, "The Liberal and Radical Year-Book." The defendant
published a similar work, intituled "The Liberal Year-Book."
It was held that they were entitled to do so, as the
plaintiffs could have no right in the title when the material was
in no sense their own.</p>

<p><i>Non-user of title</i> for a considerable period will leave it open
to others to adopt the same title and to acquire a right therein
to the exclusion of the original user,<a id="FNanchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">[1127]</a> but no representation must
be made, express or implied, that the subsequent publication is
a continuation of the first. If the proprietor of a magazine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
incorporates it with another publication, such as the <i>John Bull</i>
with the <i>Britannia</i>, and intitules the future publication with a
joint name such as the <i>John Bull and Britannia</i>, he can prevent
any taking of the original titles either <i>simpliciter</i> or colourably
altered, as, for instance, <i>The True Britannia</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">[1128]</a></p>

<p><i>No Fraud need be Proved.</i>&mdash;When the exclusive right to a title
has been established, an innocent invasion is equally as actionable
as one tainted with fraud or intent to deceive.<a id="FNanchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">[1129]</a> It is a
question what the public are likely to believe, not what it was
intended they should believe.</p>

<p><i>Must be Calculated to Deceive.</i>&mdash;The question is whether the
man of ordinary intelligence is likely to be deceived, and purchase
the later publication while intending to purchase the
original. It is not sufficient to show that some thoughtless or
stupid people have made mistakes and taken the one for the
other.<a id="FNanchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">[1130]</a> The exclusive right to the use of a title only extends so
far as to prevent the whole or any part of the title being used
in such a way as to deceive the public, to the injury of the
proprietor of the title. Thus a part of the title may be taken
and so used in conjunction with other words, that there can be
no possibility of confusion, or the whole title may be taken and
used for an entirely different class of work, or otherwise put
before the public in such a way that mistake is practically
impossible. Thus in questions of passing off, besides the
similarity of title, the result depends on the peculiar circumstances
under which the works are produced: the time and
place of publication, appearance, such as similarity in print and
binding and price, may all be of vital importance.</p>

<p><i>Cases in which an Injunction was Granted.</i>&mdash;In <i>Hogg</i> v. <i>Kirby</i><a id="FNanchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">[1131]</a>
the defendant was interested in the sale and profits of a magazine
called <i>The Wonderful Magazine</i>. A dispute arose between him
and the proprietor of the magazine, and the defendant thereupon
published a magazine under the same title, described as <i>New
Series Improved</i>. This publication was restrained. In <i>Constable</i>
v. <i>Brewster</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> a Scotch case, an interdict was granted on very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
similar facts. In <i>Chappell</i> v. <i>Sheard</i><a id="FNanchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">[1133]</a> the plaintiffs published a
song, the words of which were original, but set to an old American
air, "Lillie Dale," in which there was no copyright. This song
had become popular, and was sung at concerts by a Madame
Thillon. The plaintiffs published their song under the title of
"'Minnie,' sung by Madame Anna Thillon, written by George
Linley," and the cover bore a lithographed drawing of Madame
Thillon. The defendants set other words to the same air and published
it as "Minnie Dale," sung by Madame Thillon, and their
cover also bore a portrait of Madame Thillon. The defendants'
song had, in fact, never been sung by Madame Thillon. An injunction
was granted. In <i>Chappell</i> v. <i>Davidson</i><a id="FNanchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a> the same song was
similarly pirated by one intituled "Minnie, dear Minnie," and an
injunction was also granted. In <i>Prowett</i> v. <i>Mortimer</i><a id="FNanchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">[1135]</a> <i>The True
Britannia</i> was restrained as tending to interfere with the sale of
the plaintiff's paper, <i>The John Bull and Britannia</i>, which had
incorporated the plaintiff's previous publication, <i>The Britannia</i>.
In <i>Clement</i> v. <i>Maddick</i><a id="FNanchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a> the plaintiff owned a sporting periodical
paper, intituled <i>Bell's Life</i>. The defendants were restrained from
publishing a similar paper under the title, <i>Penny Bell's Life</i>. In
both publications the name Bell was entirely pseudonymous.
In <i>Ingram</i> v. <i>Stiff</i><a id="FNanchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a> the defendant was the proprietor of a weekly
paper, <i>The London Journal</i>, and assigned all his interest therein
to the plaintiff, covenanting not to publish any rival weekly
paper. Two years afterwards the defendant published a daily
newspaper, <i>The Daily London Journal</i>. The Court restrained him
from continuing the publication, but their judgment seems to
have gone on the ground of breach of covenant. In <i>Clowes</i> v.
<i>Hogg</i><a id="FNanchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> the proprietors of <i>London Society</i> were held entitled to an
injunction against <i>English Society</i>, but this was also on the
ground of a covenant between the parties. In <i>Corns</i> v. <i>Griffiths</i><a id="FNanchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a>
the plaintiff published a weekly newspaper under the title, "<i>Iron
Trade Circular</i> (Ryland's)." The defendant had for some considerable
time published a weekly report headed "<i>The Iron Trade</i>
(Griffith's Weekly Report)," but changed his title to "<i>The Iron</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
<i>Trade Circular</i> (edited by Samuel Griffiths)," and published it in
type and form very similar to the plaintiff's newspaper. The
defendant's publication was restrained. In <i>Metzler</i> v. <i>Wood</i><a id="FNanchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> the
plaintiffs were the publishers of "Henry's Royal Modern Tutor
for the Pianoforte." This work had a very large sale. The
defendants took an old work, intituled "Jousie's Royal Standard
Pianoforte Tutor," which had entirely fallen into disuse, and
employed Henry to revise it, and then published it as "Henry's
New and Revised Edition of Jousie's Royal Standard Pianoforte
Tutor." In both publications the word "Henry's" was published
in large letters, and was more conspicuous than any other
part of the title. The Court granted an injunction. James, L. J.,
in his judgment, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The defendants' title-page was calculated to deceive, and I cannot
conceive any reasonable theory to explain the defendants taking an
obsolete work, getting it revised by Mr. Henry, and putting Henry's name
as the prominent and striking distinguishing mark of his work except that
he intended to do that which the name was calculated to do, viz., to
mislead the public into believing that when they were buying the
defendants' work they were buying the plaintiffs'. If it was so calculated
to mislead, the case of the plaintiffs is made out."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Cases where an Injunction was Refused.</i>&mdash;In <i>Spottiswoode</i> v.
<i>Clarke</i><a id="FNanchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a> Lord Cottenham, L. C., refused an interlocutory injunction
in a case of two Pictorial Almanacks, where the covers were very
similar and could hardly have been so accidentally. In a similar
case to-day an injunction would probably have gone. In <i>Jarrold</i>
v. <i>Houlston</i><a id="FNanchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a> an injunction was refused to the author of "Why and
Because," in respect of a similar work intituled "The Reason
Why." There was no such similarity or colourable imitation in
the title as to support the claim. In <i>Bradbury</i> v. <i>Beeton</i><a id="FNanchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a> the
proprietors of <i>Punch</i> craved an injunction against <i>Punch and
Judy</i>. There was, however, no evidence that any one had been
misled, and although the papers were similar in size and general
appearance, the colour of the paper was slightly different, and
the design on the cover was entirely different. Malins, V. C.,
refused an injunction. In <i>Kelly</i> v. <i>Byles</i><a id="FNanchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor">[1144]</a> the plaintiff had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
published numerous directories called "post office" directories.
Among them was "The Post Office Directory of the West Riding
of Yorkshire." An injunction was refused against the defendant
who proposed to issue a directory under the title "Post Office
Bradford Directory." The publications in no way resembled
one another. The plaintiff claimed that he had acquired an
exclusive use to the words "post office" in connection with a
directory. It was held that he could have no such exclusive
right. In <i>Dicks</i> v. <i>Yates</i><a id="FNanchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> a serial story, entitled "Splendid
Misery, or East End and West End, by C. H. Hazlewood," was
being published in a magazine called <i>Every Week</i>. Another
weekly, <i>The World</i>, commenced a serial story intituled "Splendid
Misery, by the Author of Lady Audley's Secret, Vivian, &amp;c."
The two weekly papers were of an entirely different character,
and it was held that there was nothing in the publication of the
serial story in <i>The World</i> which was calculated to deceive. In
<i>Cowen</i> v. <i>Hulton</i><a id="FNanchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor">[1146]</a> the plaintiff was proprietor of <i>The Newcastle
Weekly Chronicle</i> and <i>The Newcastle Daily Chronicle</i>. He claimed
an exclusive right to the use of the word "Chronicle" in connection
with newspapers in Newcastle, and craved an injunction against
the sale in Newcastle of <i>The Sporting Chronicle</i>. The Court of
Appeal, reversing the decision of North, J., refused an injunction.
In <i>Walter</i> v. <i>Emmott</i><a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a> <i>The Mail</i> was published three days a
week at 11 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, price twopence. The Court refused an injunction
against <i>The Morning Mail</i>, price one halfpenny. Both
papers were published in London. In <i>Borthwick</i> v. <i>The Evening
Post</i><a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> the proprietors of <i>The Morning Post</i> claimed an injunction
against <i>The Evening Post</i>. The Court was of opinion that there
was no probability of injury to <i>The Morning Post</i> since the
papers were not competing papers. Bowen, L. J., in his judgment,
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He must be an extremely unintelligent person if he thinks that the
<i>Evening Post</i>, which disclaims all connection with the <i>Morning Post</i>, and
writes upon different topics and in a different style, is connected with the
<i>Morning Post</i>. The idea would explode itself before he got half-way
through the first page."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The injunction was refused. The commonest form of passing
off is by means of a similar title and binding, but any act
which induces the public to believe that A's book is the book of
B is equally actionable, and will be sustained. Thus for A to
announce his book as a continuation of B's book,<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a> or in any other
way to so advertise it as to induce the public to believe that it is
B's work<a id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> is actionable.</p>

<p><b>Malicious Criticism.</b>&mdash;It would be actionable to publish of
an author's work that which was obviously untrue; for instance,
that it was an immoral or a libellous work, when no suggestion
of immorality or libel could be found in it. Apart from absolute
falsehood of this kind there is no limit to the range of criticism;<a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a>
a man is entitled to form what opinion he pleases of another's
work, and to publish these opinions. So long as he confines
himself to the work criticised and the author thereof as author,
he has very full liberty of saying what he thinks.</p>

<p>It may be actionable to say that a man is the author of a
work which is not his. The offence if anything would be defamation
of the author.<a id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a></p>

<p><b>Slander of Title.</b>&mdash;No doubt an action would lie against any
one publishing statements in disparagement of the owner's
right to a literary or artistic work.<a id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> Special damage is of the
essence of such an action.</p>

<p><b>Author who has parted with Copyright is entitled to protect
his Reputation.</b>&mdash;Although a purchaser of copyright may do
what he pleases with what he has purchased, he may not mutilate
an artistic or literary work and present it to the public in its
mutilated form as the work of the original author. The copyright
in a law book was purchased by a bookseller. The author
refused to edit a third edition, and the bookseller had the
necessary alterations made for himself. The third edition was
then published without any notice that it was prepared by any
one other than the author. It contained numerous errors. In
an action by the author against the bookseller, Lord Tenterden,
C. J., in summing up, put it to the jury that if they were of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
opinion that the third edition would be understood by those who
bought it to have been prepared by the plaintiff, the plaintiff was
entitled to a verdict; but if they were of opinion that persons
using reasonable care would think that this third edition was not
prepared by the plaintiff, their verdict should be for the defendant.
The jury returned a verdict of five pounds for the plaintiff.<a id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a> The
nature of the remedy is really an action for the defamation of
the plaintiff's reputation as an author. The Court is slow to
grant an interlocutory injunction in such an action. No doubt
it would be done in an extreme case, for instance, if the owner
of performing rights in a play inserted indecent or scandalous
matter without the consent of the author, but the Court prefers
to have the legal question as to whether the altered version is
injurious to the plaintiff's reputation tried first. In <i>Cox</i> v. <i>Cox</i><a id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a>
the plaintiff had written a legal article for the purpose of insertion
in the defendant's book. The defendant revised and shortened
the article to a considerable extent, and the plaintiff applied for
an injunction in Chancery to restrain the defendant from publishing
the article in its mutilated form. Page Wood, V. C., refused
an injunction, and, in his judgment, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In respect to what was said about the plaintiff's reputation suffering
from having the legal matter supplied by him published in a mutilated
and erroneous form, according to Sir J. Clark's case,<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> the loss of reputation,
unless connected with property, was not a ground for coming to this Court,
though it might be an ingredient for the Court to consider when there was
property."</p></blockquote>

<p>One might almost infer from this judgment that if the plaintiff
had parted with his property no right of action lay for injury to
his reputation. It must be observed, however, that this was a
claim for an injunction in equity, and the judgment of Lord
Tenterden in <i>Archbold</i> v. <i>Sweet</i><a id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a> was not referred to. That and
the subsequent cases make it clear that there is a right of action
on the ground of injury to reputation alone, and that in urgent
cases the Court will interfere by interlocutory injunction. In
<i>Gilbert</i> v. <i>Boosey</i><a id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> the owner of a performing right in an opera
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
inserted without the permission of the author two songs, and one
of the author's songs was left out. The opera was advertised
and performed <i>simpliciter</i> as the plaintiff's opera without any
mention of alterations. On an application for an interlocutory
injunction, Denman, J., refused to interfere at such an early
stage, but he intimated that if the songs had been indecent or
such as would obviously damage the plaintiff's reputation, he
might have granted an injunction. In <i>Lee</i> v. <i>Gibbings</i><a id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">[1159]</a> the
defendant had acquired the copyright in the plaintiff's "Autobiography
of Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury." He published
a condensed edition, on the title-page of which the plaintiff
was stated <i>simpliciter</i> to be the author. The plaintiff alleged
that the work was unscholarly and injurious to his reputation,
and craved an interim injunction. Kekewich, J., refused the
motion. The plaintiff's remedy, he said, was founded on libel
by reason of the injury to his reputation. Of late years there
had been no such thing as an injunction to restrain a libel
(except in the case of a trade libel) on an interlocutory application
or before the point had been submitted to a jury. He
saw no reason for making an exception in the case before him,
and he would express no opinion as to whether there was a libel
or not.</p>

<p>The Court would restrain one who published a book falsely
representing that it was the work of another.<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">[1160]</a></p>

<p><b>Protection from Breach of Faith or Contract.</b>&mdash;The relationship
of parties may give rise to rights and obligations in
reference to literary or artistic matter which could not exist as
between strangers. Such rights and obligations are supported
on the various grounds of express contract, implied contract,
and breach of faith. As to express contract there is little
difficulty, the ordinary rules of contract will apply. As to implied
contract or breach of faith, these are really the same,
only common law based its remedy on the former and equity
on the latter. It usually arises in the case of a clerk or other
employee between whom and the employer a confidential relationship
exists. As regards employees, the law stated briefly is
this, that during his employment he must do nothing which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
contrary to the interests of his employer; he may not in any
way assist in the production of literary or artistic work which
may compete with the work of his employer. After the termination
of his employment, apart from express contract, he is
entitled to compete with his late employer, and for that purpose
may make use of the general knowledge and information
which he acquired in his employment: but he may not for
such purpose use any materials such as documents, notes,
printing blocks, &amp;c., which he acquired in his capacity of
employee and <i>a fortiori</i> if he acquired them surreptitiously.</p>

<p>In <i>Jovatt</i> v. <i>Winyard</i><a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">[1161]</a> a veterinary surgeon employed a journeyman
for the purpose of selling his medicine. While in such
service the journeyman surreptitiously got access to his books
of recipes and copied them. It was held that there was a breach
of trust, and the journeyman was restrained from selling the
medicines or printing or selling printed directions for their use.
In <i>Prince Albert</i> v. <i>Strange</i><a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">[1162]</a> a workman, who was entrusted by
the Prince Consort with certain plates for the purpose of reproducing
privately drawings which had from time to time been
made by Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort, in breach
of the trust reposed in him sold impressions to the defendant,
who published a descriptive catalogue of the drawings. Knight
Bruce, V. C., granted an injunction against the publication of the
catalogue. In <i>Reuter's Telegram Co.</i> v. <i>Byron</i><a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a> the defendants
had for some time acted as agents in Australia of the plaintiff
company, sending on and receiving telegraphic messages on their
behalf. In the course of this agency they became acquainted
with the cypher used by many of the company's customers.
On the termination of their employment the defendants started
a rival telegram business and sent circulars to the plaintiffs'
customers, mentioning that they had their cyphers. On a
motion to restrain the defendants from making use of the
list of cyphers acquired in the plaintiffs' employment, Jessel,
M. R., refused an interim injunction. He said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Court will always restrain a man from publishing or divulging
that which has been communicated to him in confidence. But this is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
totally different case. The plaintiffs do not here seek to restrain the
defendants from publishing anything but from making use of knowledge
acquired while the relation of principal and agent subsisted after that
relation terminated."</p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Lamb</i> v. <i>Evans</i><a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> the defendants had been employed by the
plaintiff as canvasser for his trade directory. On the termination
of their employment they published a rival directory and made
use of blocks and notes which they had acquired in the plaintiff's
employment. The Court held that this was an improper use
for the defendants to make of materials so acquired. Bowen,
L. J., in his judgment, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is not a question of copyright&mdash;that must be kept out of sight
altogether&mdash;nor is it, on the other hand, a simple question of the absolute
property at law in the documents themselves or in the blocks themselves.
It is a question of whether the plaintiff, whatever the property in the
documents may be or whatever the property in the materials may be, has
not sufficient special property in them to entitle him to restrain the use of
them against him when they had been obtained for his use by his agents
in the course of their employment. That depends entirely, I think, on
the terms upon which the employment was constituted, through which
the fiduciary relation of principal and agent came into existence."</p></blockquote>

<p>In commenting on <i>Reuter's Telegram Co.</i> v. <i>Byron</i>, the same
judge said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I think if Reuter's case is to be judged by the result, it no doubt is
right&mdash;and Sir George Jessel was generally right&mdash;but I do not think that
the propositions reported in the <i>Law Journal</i> as laid down by him can be
considered to be sound. It seems to me that as a matter at law or as a
matter of equity, the conduct of the defendants in that case cannot be
justified to the extent to which the learned judge is made by the report to
justify it. If Reuter's case is cited as an authority for the propositions
which the Master of the Rolls is there stated to have laid down, I am
not prepared to follow it."</p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Merryweather</i> v. <i>Moore</i><a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a> a clerk while in the employment of
a firm of engine-makers had made a table of dimensions of various
types of engines. After he had left their employment he was restrained
from publishing or communicating the table or its contents
to any one. In <i>Louie</i> v. <i>Smellie</i><a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> the plaintiff carried on a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
business as a process server, the defendant while in his employment
secretly made extracts from the plaintiff's register and index
of agents and copies of the plaintiff's forms. He was restrained
from making use of such extracts in competition with the
plaintiff after he had left his employment and set up as a process
server on his own account. Lindley, L. J., in his judgment,
said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As to the law it has been clearly laid down in <i>Lamb</i> v. <i>Evans</i>. It is
not new law, it is as old as the hills. The good faith that existed between
employer and employed rendered it improper for the employed to make
use of any information acquired by him during the period of the confidential
relationship."</p></blockquote>

<p>The injunction was granted in these terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"An injunction to restrain the defendant, his servants, and agents
from making use of any copies or extracts from the plaintiff's register of
agents, or index of agents, or any memoranda made or obtained by the
defendant when in the plaintiff's employ relating to any person named in
these books or either of them."</p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Robb</i> v. <i>Green</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> the defendant having been employed as
manager of the plaintiff's business, secretly copied a list of
the names and addresses of his customers. On leaving the
plaintiff's employment he set up a similar business, but was
restrained from making use of the list of his late master's customers.
In <i>Gilbert</i> v. <i>Star Newspaper</i><a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> the members of a
theatrical company taking part in the rehearsal of a new opera
were held to be under an obligation not to disclose any information
concerning it until it should be publicly performed,
and the Court restrained a critique published in a daily newspaper
on the ground that the material for it must have been
unlawfully procured.</p>

<p>In these cases it is not only the party who is in breach of contract
or confidential relationship that will be restrained. The
Court will restrain any one who, knowing how the material has
been acquired, makes use of it.<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> In <i>Tipping</i> v. <i>Clarke</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> Wigram,
V. C., said that if the defendant availed himself surreptitiously of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
the information which he could not have had except from a
person guilty of a breach of contract in communicating it, he
could not be permitted to avail himself of such breach of
contract. In <i>Abernethy</i> v. <i>Hutchinson</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> Lord Eldon said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"How the gentleman who had published the letters came by them he
did not know; but whether an action would be maintained against them
or not on the footing of implied contract, an injunction undoubtedly
might be granted, because if there had been a breach of contract on the
part of the pupil who heard these lectures, and if the pupil could not
publish for profit, to do so would certainly be what this Court would call
a fraud upon a third party."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus in <i>Prince Albert</i> v. <i>Strange</i><a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> the defendant obtained
the information from the person in whom the plaintiff's
confidence was placed, and was on that account restrained.
In the <i>Exchange Telegraph Co.</i> v. <i>Central News</i><a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> the Court
restrained a third party from publishing information which
he had obtained by inducing a subscriber to the Telegraph
Company to break his contract. If there has been a breach
of contract or trust the Court will assume a guilty knowledge
in the case of a third person, who, being in possession
of the material, cannot give any satisfactory explanation.<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a>
If a third party acquire innocently and for value materials or
information originally procured in breach of trust or contract, it
seems questionable, apart from any absolute right in the plaintiff,
such as a right to manuscript, whether he can be restrained
from making use of them in any publication. If the original
act amounts to fraud or crime, certainly the Court will not protect
even an innocent purchaser. "Let the hand receiving it be
ever so chaste, if it comes through such a corrupt and polluted
channel, the obligation of restitution must follow."<a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> But if the
original act amounted to no more than breach of confidence or
contract, it may be different, and a purchaser for value and
without notice may be excused.<a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> The point must be considered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
doubtful.<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a> The ground of action on breach of faith or
contract may sometimes exist concurrently with a ground of
action on copyright, and may be useful if there are any technical
difficulties in the plaintiff's way as to copyright.<a id="FNanchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a></p>

<p><b>Unpublished Works.</b>&mdash;The author and his assignees have the
right of first publication; this right at common law is unaffected
by the Copyright Acts, and is a right in perpetuity. The
right in literary matter in manuscript is clearly one of property,
and is independent of any confidential or contractual relation
between the author and those who interfere with his property
without authority. "It cannot," said Lord Halsbury in <i>Caird</i> v.
<i>Sime</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> "be denied that in the present state of the law an author
has a proprietary right in his unpublished literary productions."
An author may choose his own time to publish or may choose
never to publish at all, and he may proceed against any one
who attempts to publish or otherwise deals without his authority
with his unpublished work. This was definitely decided in
<i>Donaldson</i> v. <i>Beckett</i><a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a> when the question among others was put
to the judges: "Whether at common law an author of any book
or literary composition had the sole right of first printing or
publishing the same for sale; and might bring an action against
any person who printed, published, and sold the same without
his consent?" Ten out of eleven judges consulted answered
that there was such a right, and eight of them that an action lay
in cases of infringement. Two of the judges, however, were of
opinion that an action lay against an infringer only when the
manuscript had been obtained by fraud or violence. Only one
judge held that there was no right of first publication. In <i>Prince
Albert</i> v. <i>Strange</i><a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a> Lord Cottenham, L. C., considered the law as
well settled and beyond dispute. He says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The property of an author or composer of any work, whether of
literature, art, or science, in such work unpublished and kept for his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
private use or pleasure, cannot be disputed after the many decisions in
which the proposition has been affirmed or assumed."</p></blockquote>

<p>The right of an author to his unpublished work is of a much
wider and more exclusive nature than his right to published
matter. It probably extends to prohibit any kind of interference
whatsoever.<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> The public have not the right of "fair use" comment
and criticism which they have in a published work. In
<i>Prince Albert</i> v. <i>Strange</i> Knight Bruce, V. C.,<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A work lawfully published in the popular sense of the term stands
in this respect, I conceive, differently from a work which has never been
in that situation. The former may be liable to be translated, abridged,
analysed, exhibited in morsels, complimented and otherwise treated in a
manner that the latter is not."</p></blockquote>

<p>The reason that private documents of a man should be protected
from any interference whatsoever is sufficiently obvious.
"A man," says Knight Bruce, V. C., in the same case,<a id="FNanchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> "may
employ himself in private in a manner very harmless, but which
disclosed to society may destroy the comfort of his life or even
his success in it." In <i>Miller</i> v. <i>Taylor</i><a id="FNanchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> Yates, J., expresses the
principle of the common law protection:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Ideas are free. But while the author confines them to his study
they are like birds in a cage which none but he can have a right to let fly;
for till he thinks proper to emancipate them they are under his own
dominion. It is certain every man has a right to keep his own sentiments
if he pleases: he has certainly a right to judge whether he will make
them public or commit them only to the sight of his friends. In that state
the manuscript is in every sense his peculiar property, and no man can take
it from him or make any use of it which he has not authorised without
being guilty of a violation of his property."</p></blockquote>

<p>The common law right in manuscript ceases upon "communication
to the public" with the consent of the author,<a id="FNanchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> but it
may still continue notwithstanding some kind of communication
to others. The communication in order to divest the owner of
common law right must be an abandonment of his ideas and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
words to the use of the public at large. Representation on the
stage, delivery as a lecture, a gift or loan of the manuscript to a
friend do not <i>ipso facto</i> determine the author's right of property.<a id="FNanchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a>
The questions in cases of alleged unlawful publication of manuscript
are usually: What is to be presumed as the reasonable understanding
between the author and the persons to whom literary
matter in the manuscript is communicated? Are they intended
to have the right of making any use they please of it, or do the
circumstances raise a presumption that they may only use it for
a limited purpose? In <i>Macklin</i> v. <i>Richardson</i><a id="FNanchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> the Court held
that although a play had been performed on the stage, that was
only a limited publication of it, and therefore the exclusive right
to publish remained in the author.<a id="FNanchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> In <i>Nicols</i> v. <i>Pitman</i><a id="FNanchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> a
lecture delivered at a Working Men's College from a manuscript
previously prepared, was reproduced by the defendant without
the plaintiff's consent. Kay, J., granted an injunction. In
<i>Caird</i> v. <i>Sime</i><a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> the professor of moral philosophy in Glasgow
University delivered a course of lectures in pursuance of his
duty as professor. These were published by a bookseller from
notes taken by a student. It was strenuously argued that the
professorship being a <i>munus publicum</i> and the classes being open
to all comers, the delivery of the lectures was really a publication
without reserve to the whole world. The House of Lords rejected
this argument, and held that the right to publish was
reserved, the persons who were present at the lecture not being
the general public, but a limited class of the public selected and
admitted for the sole and special purpose of receiving individual
instruction. Lord Halsbury, L. C., in giving judgment, suggested
possible cases where it would be implied from the circumstances
that there was publication to the world at large:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is intelligible that when a person speaks a speech to which all the
world is invited, either expressly or impliedly, to listen, or preaches a
sermon<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> in a church, the doors of which are thrown open to all mankind,
the mode and manner of publication negative, as it appears to me, any
limitation."<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span></p>

<p>The same rules apply to communication by delivery of the
manuscript or a copy. If I give my manuscript to another to
read or for any other limited purpose, he may not exceed the
limits of use expressly or impliedly agreed. Publication by
printing and circulation among a limited class will not destroy
the common law right.<a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a></p>

<p>The common law right in a manuscript may be abandoned
by neglect or acquiescence in an adverse use. Thus it was said
that Southey had no right to complain when having left his
poem "Wat Tyler" in the hands of a publisher for twenty-three
years the publisher published it for his own profit.<a id="FNanchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a></p>

<p>A man's right to the exclusive use of his unpublished work
does not depend on its value, and it is immaterial whether he
did or did not intend to make profit by its publication.<a id="FNanchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> It is
also immaterial whether the publication would prove creditable
or discreditable, advantageous or disadvantageous.<a id="FNanchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a></p>

<p>The question has been raised whether the Courts would
prevent an unauthorised person from publishing manuscript of
an immoral nature which the author may have repented of and
refused to place before the public.<a id="FNanchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a></p>

<p>Ignorance of the author's right is no defence to an action
for interfering with unpublished literary matter. A <i>bonâ fide</i>
purchaser for value gets no better title than the original
pirate.<a id="FNanchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a></p>

<p><b>Speeches and Sermons.</b>&mdash;Literary matter delivered orally from
an extempore composition without having been previously reduced
to writing, is protected at common law from unauthorised
use. The extent of the protection as in the case of delivery
from manuscript is defined by the terms of the relationship
existing between the speaker and his audience. He may have
freely abandoned all exclusive interest in the matter of his
address, or he may give them only the right to listen, or he may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
give them the right of taking notes and using them for their own
instruction. It seems to be doubtful, however, whether the
right in unwritten speeches is one based on property, or whether
it must depend entirely on implied contract between the speaker
and his audience. In <i>Abernethy</i> v. <i>Hutchinson</i><a id="FNanchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> Dr. Abernethy
delivered surgical lectures to students at St. Bartholomew's
Hospital. These lectures had not been previously reduced to
writing. Lord Eldon, L. C., granted an injunction against their
unauthorised reproduction in the <i>Lancet</i>. There was no evidence
as to how the defendants got possession of the lectures,
but Lord Eldon thought that was immaterial:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"They must have been taken from a pupil or otherwise in such a way
as the Court would not permit, and the injunction ought to go on the
ground of property, and although there was not sufficient to establish an
implied contract as between the plaintiffs and the defendants, yet it must
be decided that as the lectures must have been procured in an undue
manner from those who were under a contract not to publish for profit,
there was sufficient to authorise the Court to say the defendants shall not
publish."</p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Nicols</i> v. <i>Pitman</i><a id="FNanchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a> a case of previously written lectures,
Kay, J., reviews the judgment of Lord Eldon in the last cited
case:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now it is quite true that the learned judge seems at one moment to
refer to the ground of property and at another to that of implied contract.
But I take his meaning to be this, that when a lecture of this kind is
delivered to an audience, especially when the audience is a limited one
admitted by tickets, the understanding between the lecturer and the
audience is that, whether the lecture has been committed to writing beforehand
or not, the audience are quite at liberty to take the fullest notes they
like for their own personal purposes, but they are not at liberty having
taken those notes to use them afterwards for the purpose of publishing
the lecture for profit."</p></blockquote>

<p>The question of whether the right in an oral speech is property
or not might well be of the highest importance in a question
between the speaker and a publisher who acquired the
matter in entire ignorance of his right. The facts might be such
that the Court would not, as they did in <i>Abernethy</i> v. <i>Hutchinson</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
presume that the material "must have been procured in an
undue manner." If there was no such presumption from the
facts, it would appear that, apart from a right of property, the
speaker must be without remedy unless he has given notice as
a lecturer within 5 &amp; 6 Will. IV. c. 65.<a id="FNanchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a></p>

<p><b>Letters.</b>&mdash;Private letters are protected from publication as
much as any other manuscript. In an early case<a id="FNanchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a> it was
suggested that there could be no property in business letters or
others with no literary merit; but as the idea of literary merit
in connection with copyright is now entirely exploded, the
<i>obiter dicta</i> in this case may be disregarded. In all letters then
there is a literary property in the writer which entitles him or
his executors to prohibit any publication without his consent,
express or implied.<a id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> It is immaterial whether the publication is
for the purpose of profit or not.<a id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> If a letter is written by one as
agent for another the property is in the principal, and the agent
cannot restrain him from publishing.<a id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a> The receiver of a letter
has a property in the paper on which it is written<a id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> and is
entitled to retain possession even against the writer. The receiver
may make no use of a letter except such as is implied in the
sending or with the consent of the writer.<a id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a> The receiver may
even be restrained from parting with possession or showing
the letters to any one.<a id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a> The receiver is probably entitled to
prevent the publication of the letters from copies not in his
possession or from the originals which have passed from
his possession.<a id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a></p>

<p>Although the sender has a right of property in the literary
matter in the letters, the receiver may without his consent
destroy the letters and so destroy the writer's chance of obtaining
benefit from them. The literary property of the writer and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
the property in the paper of the receiver descend to their respective
executors.<a id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a> The question has been suggested but never answered:
What would be the rights of trustees in bankruptcy to publish
for the benefit of creditors private letters?<a id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a> Letters may be
published against the will of the writer when published <i>bonâ fide</i>
for the purpose of vindication of character.<a id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

PUBLISHING AND PRINTING AGREEMENTS</h2>

<p><i>Publishers' Agreements.</i>&mdash;These agreements are governed by
the law of contract, and only incidentally involve questions of
copyright. The contract between an author and his publisher
is a personal one and cannot be assigned; each party is presumed
to have relied on the personal skill or reputation of the
other.<a id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">[1215]</a> Thus it was held that a half profit agreement could not
be assigned by a publisher's firm to a firm which had succeeded
to their business but which contained none of the partners
of the original firm.<a id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">[1216]</a> The same principle has been applied in
the case of a limited company carrying on a publishing business.<a id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">[1217]</a>
A publishing agreement ought to provide for an assignment
of the publisher's rights and obligations to the person or persons
who may succeed to the business. Unless otherwise agreed,
the death or bankruptcy of a publisher will terminate a publishing
agreement.<a id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">[1218]</a> Similarly if an author had not performed
his part of an agreement, viz. to write and revise the manuscript,
his death<a id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">[1219]</a> or bankruptcy<a id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">[1220]</a> would terminate his obligations in
that respect. The publisher could not insist on the author's
representatives completing the work, nor could they if they
completed the work insist on the publisher publishing.<a id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">[1221]</a></p>

<p>An agreement to write a book or an article cannot be enforced
by specific performance.<a id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">[1222]</a> The only remedy for breach
is an action for damages,<a id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">[1223]</a> or, if the author has agreed not to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
write on a particular subject for any one else, that may be
enforced by an injunction.<a id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">[1224]</a> An agreement to assign a copyright
may be enforced by specific performance,<a id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">[1225]</a> and probably
also an agreement to furnish an unpublished manuscript already
completed. An undertaking to write a book on a particular
subject is not fulfilled by furnishing a translation of a foreign
work on that subject.<a id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">[1226]</a> If A agrees with B to write an article
for a certain publication or series of publications, and if before
the article can be published the publication or series has been
discontinued, A is not bound to deliver his article for publication
in another form; but he is entitled to a <i>quantum meruit</i> for
the work he has done.<a id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">[1227]</a></p>

<p>If an author has entered into a royalty agreement with a
publisher he is not, apart from express agreement, under any
obligation not to publish the work through another publisher
before the first edition has been sold out.<a id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">[1228]</a> An author should
therefore be bound not to publish elsewhere so long as the
publisher is willing and ready to publish, and if this is done the
publisher may restrain the author or another publisher who
publishes with notice of his agreement.<a id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">[1229]</a> In a half profit agreement
where nothing was said as to future editions, it was
thought that the contract might probably be determined by
either party on the expiry of each edition and before any expense
had been incurred in respect of a future edition; but until that
was done the publisher had the exclusive right to publish and
recoup himself for his outlay and earn profits.<a id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">[1230]</a></p>

<p>It is not illegal as being in restraint of trade for an author to
contract to write only for a single publisher or theatrical manager,<a id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">[1231]</a>
nor for a publisher to contract not to publish a particular class
of work.<a id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">[1232]</a> If an editor engages to give his whole time to a
publication, he will be restrained from engaging in or advertising
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
any rival work.<a id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">[1233]</a> Unless there is an express stipulation an
author will not be prevented under a publishing agreement from
writing and publishing other books on the same subject provided
they do not reproduce in whole or in part the former
book.<a id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">[1234]</a> If there is an express stipulation against publishing
similar works, both the author and his publisher would be
restrained from doing so.<a id="FNanchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor">[1235]</a> Apart from express agreement a
publisher is probably free to publish any other rival work he
pleases, even although it may seriously affect the sale of the
former book.<a id="FNanchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor">[1236]</a></p>

<p>In the absence of express stipulation, the publisher under a
half profit agreement has been held entitled to fix the selling
price, choose the embellishments, and generally control the
publication.<a id="FNanchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor">[1237]</a></p>

<p>In a publishing agreement it should always be expressly
stated who is to hold the copyright. It has been held that
where no mention of the copyright was made a half profit
agreement did not import a transfer of the copyright to the
publisher.<a id="FNanchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor">[1238]</a> In editorial agreements as to newspapers or magazines
similar careful provision should be made as to who is to
own the copyright and the goodwill in the name, otherwise
difficult questions may arise.<a id="FNanchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor">[1239]</a></p>

<p>Where the author of a novel sold the copyright therein to
the owners of a periodical, reserving to himself the right to
publish in "volume form," it was held that under this agreement
he was entitled to publish the work in weekly parts, which
when completed could be bound into a volume.<a id="FNanchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor">[1240]</a></p>

<p>An indemnity given by an author to a publisher against proceedings
for libel is void if the publisher knew or ought to have
known that the matter was libellous.<a id="FNanchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor">[1241]</a> The publisher, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
would be entitled to rely on such an indemnity if he acted
innocently. The same principle would apply to proceedings
for infringement of copyright.</p>

<p>A publishing agreement may be made orally unless, which
will seldom happen, it cannot be performed within a year from
the making thereof, in which case there must be a written
memorandum of the terms to satisfy the Statute of Frauds.<a id="FNanchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor">[1242]</a></p>

<p>The agreement, if in writing, must be stamped with the
usual sixpenny agreement stamp. If it contains a conveyance
of a copyright it will probably have to be stamped with <i>ad
valorem</i> duty under section 53 of the Stamp Act.<a id="FNanchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor">[1243]</a> If the work
is unpublished at the time of the agreement the whole interest
in the manuscript can be conveyed by delivery; in the
case of a published work the copyright could be conveyed by
entry on the register, so that in neither case need there be a
conveyance in the agreement, and the stamp duty can thus be
avoided. If a copyright is conveyed by entry on the register,
the Copyright Act expressly exempts the conveyance from
duty.<a id="FNanchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor">[1244]</a></p>

<p><i>Printers' Agreements.</i>&mdash;A printer has a lien on the books
printed by him for his printing charges.<a id="FNanchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor">[1245]</a> He has no lien on
stereotype plates for the amount of the bill for printing from
them.<a id="FNanchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor">[1246]</a> If the printer does not print his name and address on
a book as required by Act of Parliament<a id="FNanchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor">[1247]</a> he will not be entitled
to recover his printing charges.<a id="FNanchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor">[1248]</a> An order to print a certain
number of copies of a book must as a rule be treated as an
entire order, and no payment will fall due until the whole are
complete and ready for delivery, so that if when half finished
they are destroyed by fire he will not be entitled to recover for
the work done.<a id="FNanchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor">[1249]</a> A printer does not insure the manuscript when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
in his possession,<a id="FNanchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor">[1250]</a> but is only liable for loss occasioned by his
negligence.</p>

<p>A printer cannot maintain an action in respect of his charges
for printing an immoral or seditious work, knowing it to be
such.<a id="FNanchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor">[1251]</a> If while a book is being printed by him he discovers that
it contains libellous, seditious, or immoral matter, he would be
entitled to discontinue the printing and sue for the work already
done.<a id="FNanchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor">[1252]</a></p>

<h3>ADDENDUM</h3>

<p><b>Musical Copyright, Summary Remedies.</b>&mdash;A Bill has passed both
Houses of Parliament and awaits the Royal Assent whereby, after October
1902, owners of copyright in music may proceed in a Court of summary
jurisdiction against persons dealing in pirated music. Piratical copies
which are being hawked or offered for sale may be seized by a constable
without warrant and brought before the Court, which, on proof, may order
the copies to be forfeited or destroyed, and inflict a penalty not exceeding
twenty pounds on any one offender in respect of the same transaction.
This Act will not apply outside the United Kingdom.

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>

<p>The law of copyright in the United States, especially in
relation to literary work, is daily becoming of more interest to
the owners of copyright in this country. Since the <i>Act of
Congress</i>, 1891, commonly known as the <i>Chace Act</i>, those who
are neither citizens of nor resident in the United States can
acquire a copyright therein if copies of their books are printed
from type set up in the United States and if their books
are duly recorded there before publication either within or
outside the United States. There is thus created for English
authors a property which may be of considerable value if
before publishing here they incur the trouble and expense of
printing and recording their books in America.</p>

<p>Apart from this commercial interest which English authors
and publishers have in a knowledge of American copyright
law, there is the further interest to English lawyers in the
large body of analogous case law to which the American
statutes have given rise. These statutes were originally founded
on our own statute of Anne, and, although the difference
between the Acts now in force in the two countries is very
wide in many respects, a great deal remains the same in
substance, and the decisions of the American Courts afford
us valuable precedents. These cases, however, must not be
cited in our Courts at random, as has too frequently been
done. In citing from the American reports, it is essential
to compare the statutory provisions in America with the
statutory provisions in this country, and ascertain whether
the decisions are really applicable or not. It is for this
reason that I have thought it expedient to keep the American
law and the English law entirely separate. The practice of citing
American cases promiscuously throughout a treatise on English
Copyright Law I have found to be confusing and misleading.

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

WHAT WORKS ARE ENTITLED TO COPYRIGHT</h2>

<p>In order to acquire copyright in the United States the work
must fulfil the following conditions:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. It must be an original literary or artistic work.</span>

<span class="i0">2. The (owner/author) must be a citizen of the United States (or
resident therein), or of a foreign country proclaimed
to that intent by the President.<a id="FNanchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor">[1253]</a></span>

<span class="i0">3. It must have complied with the formalities prescribed
by the statutes of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor">[1254]</a></span>

<span class="i0">4. It must be innocent.<a id="FNanchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor">[1255]</a></span>
</div></div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section I.&mdash;An Original Literary or Artistic Work.</span></h3>

<p>In the United States literary and artistic works are treated
similarly under the same series of statutes. The works protected
are enumerated in section 4952 of the Revised Statutes as
amended by the Act of March 3, 1891 (<i>The Chace Act</i>). The
protection extends to any book, map, chart, dramatic or
musical composition, engraving, cut, print, or photograph or
negative thereof, and to any painting, drawing, chromo, statue,
statuary, and to models or designs intended to be perfected as
works of the fine arts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The scope
of the Constitution.</div>

<p>In considering whether a work is within the protection of
the Copyright Acts, not only must the enacting words of the
statutes be considered, but also, and perhaps principally, the
scope of the provision in the Constitution, which grants power
to Congress to secure the protection of authors and artists.<a id="FNanchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor">[1256]</a>
The language of the Act must be read in connection with the
Constitutional provision and be so construed as to promote the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
object and conform to the purpose expressed therein. The
power given to Congress by the Constitution is a power "to
promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for
limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to
their respective writings and discoveries." In consideration of
this restricted power the earlier decisions<a id="FNanchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor">[1257]</a> construed the Acts
of Congress as including only those works which showed a
certain degree of intellectual labour in the arts or sciences.
In <i>Clayton</i> v. <i>Stone</i><a id="FNanchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor">[1258]</a> protection was refused to a daily price
current or review of the markets issued in a newspaper.
Thompson, J., in giving judgment, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Act was passed in execution of the power given by Congress,
and the object therefore was the promotion of science; and it would
certainly be a pretty extraordinary view of the sciences to consider a daily
or weekly publication of the state of the market as falling within any class
of them. They are of a more fixed, permanent, and durable character.
The term science cannot with any propriety be applied to a work of so
fluctuating and fugitive a form as that of a newspaper or price current, the
subject-matter of which is daily changing, and is of mere temporary use....
The title of the Act of Congress is for the encouragement of learning,
and was not intended for the encouragement of mere industry unconnected
with learning and the sciences."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Illustrated Catalogues.</div>

<p>This high standard of intellectual requirement was not,
however, strictly maintained. In <i>Brightley</i> v. <i>Littleton</i><a id="FNanchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor">[1259]</a> a blank
form of application for a licence to sell liquor at retail, drawn
in pursuance of the statutes in that behalf, was protected, and it
was said that, although the matter claiming copyright must be
original and possess some possible utility, "the originality may
be of the lowest order and the utility barely perceptible." In
<i>Ladd</i> v. <i>Oxnard</i><a id="FNanchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor">[1260]</a> the English cases of <i>Lamb</i> v. <i>Evans</i><a id="FNanchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor">[1261]</a> and <i>Leslie</i>
v. <i>Young</i><a id="FNanchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor">[1262]</a> were cited with approval, and the Court agreed that
"the quality and grade of original work required by the Courts
under the Copyright Statutes are very moderate." Until the
case of <i>Mott</i> v. <i>Clow</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor">[1263]</a> the tendency seems to have been to follow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
the English judges to their extreme view, as expressed by Lord
Halsbury in <i>Walter</i> v. <i>Lane</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor">[1264]</a> <i>i. e.</i> "that the copyright law requires
neither literary merit nor intellectual labour nor originality
either in thought or in language." The Court, however, in
<i>Mott</i> v. <i>Clow</i><a id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">[1265]</a> refused to follow the English decisions. After
reviewing the American, and particularly the earlier American
decisions, they say:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The result of these decisions would seem to place this construction
upon the Constitutional provisions under consideration that only such
writings and discoveries are included which are the result of intellectual
labour; that the term writings may be liberally construed to include
designs for engravings and prints that are original and are founded in the
creative powers of the mind, the fruits of intellectual labour; that prints
upon a single sheet might be considered a book if it otherwise met the
spirit of the constitutional provision; and that to be entitled to a copyright,
the article must have, by and of itself, some value as a composition,
at least to the extent of serving some purpose other than a mere advertisement
or designation of the subject to which it is attached."</p></blockquote>

<p>The "book" before the Court was a catalogue in the form
of a bound volume, containing illustrations of household wares
offered for sale, and giving the dimensions and price of each.
The Court referred to <i>Maple</i> v. <i>Junior Army and Navy Stores</i><a id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">[1266]</a>
where a similar catalogue in England was protected.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is to be observed in this case that it was ruled largely upon the
language of the Act of Parliament (5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45).... It is to be here
remarked that the Parliament of Great Britain, unlike the Congress of the
United States, is unlimited in power, and with the construction and effect
placed upon the preamble of the Act by the Court, there would seem to
be little escape from the conclusion at which the Court arrived. In this
country under the Constitution the power lodged with the Congress is
not unlimited, but is restricted to the promotion of the progress of science
and useful arts. The ruling of the English Court is therefore not pertinent
except as it illustrates the subject."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Court cited with approval <i>Baker</i> v. <i>Selden</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">[1267]</a> which had
expressly approved <i>Cobbett</i> v. <i>Woodward</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">[1268]</a> an English case
overruled in <i>Maple</i> v. <i>Junior Army and Navy Stores</i>;<a id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">[1269]</a> they
further cited and approved the judgment of Thompson, J., in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
<i>Clayton</i> v. <i>Stone</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">[1270]</a> quoted above. The judgment concludes with
the following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is possibly not beyond comprehension that pictures of slop-sinks,
wash-bowls, and bath-tubs, with or without letterpress statement of
dimensions and prices, though intended mainly for advertisement, may in
localities where such conveniences are not in common use, be the means
of instruction and of advancement in knowledge of the arts, and, when
they are the products of original intellectual thought, may possibly come
within the scope of the Constitutional provision. It is enough for the
present purpose to say that, in our judgment, the Congress has not seen
fit to enact a law which can reasonably be given so broad a construction."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">Forms of

<p>In considering the authority of some of the cases cited
below, the judgment in <i>Mott</i> v. <i>Clow</i><a id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">[1271]</a> must not be lost sight of.
It is probable that some of these cases are not in accordance
with it, or with the older cases, such as <i>Clayton</i> v. <i>Stone</i><a id="FNanchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">[1272]</a> and
<i>Baker</i> v. <i>Selden</i><a id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">[1273]</a> therein expressly approved. Subject to this
note of warning, the following may be taken as examples
of what have and what have not been accepted as works of
art or literature within the scope of the Constitution and the
Acts of Congress. Directories<a id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">[1274]</a> and dictionaries<a id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">[1275]</a> have both
been protected. In the case of the latter, there is copyright in
the definitions of the words, however short. A list of the credit
ratings of marble, granite, and stone dealers of the United States
and Canada was protected in <i>Ladd</i> v. <i>Oxnard</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">[1276]</a> In <i>Clayton</i> v.
<i>Stone</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">[1277]</a> which has been approved as sound law,<a id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">[1278]</a> a daily state of
the market was refused protection. A racing guide containing
a list of race-horses and statistics as to their age and performances
was protected in one case,<a id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">[1279]</a> and in the other case a list of
trotting horses and their paces.<a id="FNanchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">[1280]</a> In <i>Brightley</i> v. <i>Littleton</i><a id="FNanchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">[1281]</a> a
blank form of application for liquor licence was held to be
copyright. In <i>Carlisle</i> v. <i>Colusa County</i><a id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">[1282]</a> copyright was denied
to a blank form of property statement for assessment purposes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
</p>
<p>This latter decision appears, however, to have been partly
on the ground that as the assessors were obliged to issue a
form, it would embarrass their duties if forms drawn up by
private persons were entitled to copyright.</p>

<p>A circular in pamphlet form used as an advertisement,
and explaining a certain method of distribution of coupons
to cash purchasers from certain merchants named in the
pamphlet, has been held to be the subject of copyright.<a id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">[1283]</a>
The circuit judge, however, in his judgment, says: "It requires
some stretch of imagination to say that this pamphlet
comes within the purpose of Congress, the encouragement of
learning, and the increase of useful knowledge, but the official
charged with the duty has granted a copyright to this pamphlet,
and his decision is accepted."<a id="FNanchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">[1284]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dramatic
Works.</div>

<p>Dramatic works<a id="FNanchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">[1285]</a> have been protected, although not of a
very high literary standard. In <i>Henderson</i> v. <i>Tompkins</i><a id="FNanchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">[1286]</a> protection
was given to a topical song which was designed merely
to amuse. It was sufficient if it accomplished that purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Law
Reports.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Statutes.</div>

<p>Law Reports are protected so far as they consist of
original intellectual matter;<a id="FNanchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">[1287]</a> the protection may thus extend
to the title-page, table of cases, the head notes, the statements
of facts, the argument of counsel, the index, the order and
arrangement of cases, the numbering and pagination of the
volumes, the table of cases cited in the opinions, the subdivision
of the index into condensed titles, and the cross
references.<a id="FNanchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">[1288]</a> The original work of the reporter is alone protected.<a id="FNanchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">[1289]</a>
In the opinion of the Court there is no copyright;<a id="FNanchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">[1290]</a>
these constitute part of the law of the land open to all to
make use of as they please, and neither the state, the judge,
nor the reporter can acquire or confer any conclusive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
privilege of copying them. The same rule applies to the
head notes in those states where they are prepared by the
judge.<a id="FNanchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">[1291]</a> On the same grounds of public policy no one
can have copyright in the statutes;<a id="FNanchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">[1292]</a> the legislature of the
state cannot confer it on any one.<a id="FNanchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">[1293]</a> There may be copyright
in the head notes and arrangement of a digest of the
statutes.<a id="FNanchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">[1294]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Notes and

Adaptations.</div>

<p>The contents of a book do not require to be entirely new;
if partially old there will be copyright <i>quoad</i> the new material
or new arrangement.<a id="FNanchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">[1295]</a> Thus there is copyright in notes and
additions to an old work,<a id="FNanchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">[1296]</a> in a new arithmetic combining old
material in new form,<a id="FNanchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">[1297]</a> in translations,<a id="FNanchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">[1298]</a> in the adaptation of an
old drama introducing a new title, new dialogue, minor characters,
scenery, and dramatic situations with the orchestration
and orchestra part songs and music,<a id="FNanchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">[1299]</a> and in the dramatization
of a novel.<a id="FNanchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">[1300]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Musical
Arrangement.</div>

<p>In one case it was held that the adaptation of a musical
piece from the notation suitable to one instrument to that
suitable to another was not a sufficiently intellectual process
to entitle the adapter to copyright in his adaptations.<a id="FNanchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">[1301]</a> It was
said that "a mere mechanic could make the adaptation and
accompaniment." Since then, however, it has been held that
a musical arrangement is the subject of copyright. In <i>Thomas</i>
v. <i>Lennox</i><a id="FNanchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">[1302]</a> an orchestral accompaniment for a non-copyright
oratorio by Gounod was held to be the subject of copyright.
In <i>Carte</i> v. <i>Evans</i><a id="FNanchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">[1303]</a> an arrangement for the pianoforte of the
orchestral score of an opera was held to be copyright.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>

<p>Copyright in new editions runs <i>quoad</i> the new material

must be of substantial value. A work which is <i>publici

<p>A book need not be a book in the ordinary sense of the
word; the word in the Act is not to be construed by reference
to lexicographers: "the literary property to be protected by
the Act is not to be determined by the size, form, or shape in
which it makes its appearance, but by the subject-matter."<a id="FNanchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">[1306]</a> A
single sheet containing literary matter will be protected as a
book.<a id="FNanchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">[1307]</a> No doubt, however, the subject to be protected must
be <i>ejusdem generis</i> as a book or leaflet. The subject-matter
must convey, and the form must be suitably adapted for conveying,
information to the reader. The copyright law embraces
those things that are printed and published for information and
not for use in themselves. Thus what is really a mechanical
instrument, and if original entitled to protection under the
patent law, will not be protected by the copyright law. In
<i>Amberg File</i> v. <i>Shea</i><a id="FNanchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">[1308]</a> protection was claimed in a letter file. It
was said that the spaces between the index letters were adjusted
to the average requirements of the correspondent. These
average requirements were ascertained by exhaustive research
in different directories. Copyright was refused. In <i>Baker</i> v.
<i>Selden</i><a id="FNanchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">[1309]</a> blank account books of an original type or pattern were
refused protection. The judge in that case drew the distinction
between what was a proper subject of the patent laws
and what was a proper subject of copyright law&mdash;"The object
of the one is explanation, the object of the other is use."<a id="FNanchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">[1310]</a> In
<i>Drury</i> v. <i>Ewing</i><a id="FNanchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">[1311]</a> a "ladies' chart for cutting dresses and
basques for ladies, and coats, jackets, &amp;c., for boys" was
protected. It is almost certain, however, that this decision
would not now be accepted as sound. Mere labels will not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
be protected as copyright works.<a id="FNanchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">[1312]</a> They may be protected by
registration in the Patent Office.<a id="FNanchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">[1313]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Originality.</div>

<p>Copyright may be obtained for works of the imagination,
or for a mere collection and arrangement of material open to
all mankind.<a id="FNanchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">[1314]</a> What is meant by originality as a requisite of
copyright is that what is claimed as the subject of copyright,
whether it be the composition or arrangement of matter, must
not have been taken from some literary or artistic work already
in existence. It need not be the first of its kind; the same
thing may have been done before so as to produce identically
the same result.<a id="FNanchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">[1315]</a> If the second author, artist, or composer
goes about his work independently, searching out his material
from the original sources, he is equally entitled to copyright
with the first. Herein copyright law differs from the law of
patents; in the former there may be two concurrent copyrights
in what is identically the same creation, in the latter
there can only be one patent, the first inventor being entitled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letters.</div>

<p>Letters may be the subject of copyright, whether of a
business or private nature, and although never intended by the
writer to be published as literary productions. In <i>Folsom</i> v.
<i>Marsh</i><a id="FNanchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">[1316]</a> the letters of George Washington were the subject of
controversy. Story, J., in giving judgment, laid down the law
as to the property in letters at some length:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is no small confusion in the books with reference to the
question of copyright in letters. Some of the <i>dicta</i> seem to suppose that
no copyright can exist except in letters which are professedly literary,
while others again recognise a much more enlarged and liberal doctrine
upon the whole subject. In the first place I hold that the author of any
letter or letters (and his representatives), whether they are literary compositions
or familiar letters or letters of business, possess the sole and
exclusive copyright therein; and that no persons, neither those to whom
they are addressed nor other persons, have any right or authority to publish
the same upon their own account or for their own benefit. But consistently
with this right the persons to whom they are addressed may have,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
nay, must by implication possess the right to publish any letter or letters
addressed to them upon such occasions as require or justify the publication
or public use of them, but this right is strictly limited to such
occasions. Thus a person may justifiably use and publish in a suit at
law or in equity such letter or letters as are necessary and proper to
establish his right to maintain the suit or defend the same. So if he be
aspersed or misrepresented by the writer or accused of improper conduct
in a public manner, he may publish such parts of such letter or letters,
but no more, as may be necessary to vindicate his character and his
reputation, or free him from unjust obloquy and reproach. If he attempt
to publish such letter or letters on other occasions not justifiable, a Court
of Equity will prevent the publication by an injunction as a breach of
private confidence or contract or of the rights of the author, and <i>a fortiori</i>
if he attempt to publish them for profit, for then it is not a mere breach
of confidence or contract, but it is a violation of the exclusive copyright
of the writer. In short, the person to whom letters are addressed has but
a limited right or special property (if I may so call it) in such letters as a
trustee, or bailee for particular purposes, either of information or of protection
or of support of his own rights and character. The general
property and the general rights incident to property belong to the writer,
whether the letters are literary compositions or familiar letters or details
of facts or letters of business. The general property in the manuscript
remains in the writer and his representatives as well as the general copyright.
<i>A fortiori</i> third persons standing in no privity with either party
are not entitled to publish them to subserve their own private purposes of
interest or curiosity or passion."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is not quite accurate to say that the receiver of a letter is
merely a trustee or bailee for particular purposes. Clearly the
receiver of a letter is entitled to destroy it unless there is any
express or implied stipulation to the contrary, and probably he
can prevent the sender from publishing it by refusing to produce
it if it is in his possession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No Copyright
in
Titles.</div>

<p>As a rule there can be no copyright in a title.<a id="FNanchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">[1317]</a> The deposit
of the title-page with the Librarian of Congress does not give
the author any exclusive right to the use of that title.<a id="FNanchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">[1318]</a> A title
can only be protected as a trade mark in connection with a
particular literary or artistic production which has become
known to the public. The public must be shown to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
deceived or to be in danger of being deceived.<a id="FNanchor_1319" href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">[1319]</a> A title may be
protected by registration as a trade mark.<a id="FNanchor_1320" href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">[1320]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Photographs.</div>

<p>Photographs were first protected by the Statute of March
3, 1865; before then protection was refused to them under
the head of prints, cuts, or engravings.<a id="FNanchor_1321" href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">[1321]</a> It seems to have
been doubted at one time whether the protection of photographs
was not <i>ultra vires</i> of the powers conferred by the
Constitution. There is certainly an apparent difficulty in
bringing a photograph within the expression "writings"
used in the Constitution; but this word has received an
extremely wide and liberal construction, and has been held
to be capable of including any literary or artistic production of
the intellect. Photographs have been now frequently protected,
but it is not every photograph that will be protected,
there must be some evidence that the photographer has
exercised an intellectual choice of subject-matter, expression,
arrangement, light, or other circumstances or conditions which
go to the production of an artistic photograph.<a id="FNanchor_1322" href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">[1322]</a> It will be a
question of fact for the Court or jury whether the photograph
is a mere manual reproduction of subject-matter or an original
work of art.<a id="FNanchor_1323" href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">[1323]</a> In a portrait there may be copyright in so
far as the photographer has relied on his own judgment for
the choice of light, background, pose, or attitude.<a id="FNanchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">[1324]</a> In one
case the photograph of a yacht under sail was protected. It
required the photographer to select and utilise the best effects
of light, cloud, water, and general surroundings, and combine
them under favourable conditions for depicting vividly and
accurately the view of a yacht under sail.<a id="FNanchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">[1325]</a></p>

<p>A slight colourable alteration in a non-copyright photograph
will not entitle it to copyright.<a id="FNanchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">[1326]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Engravings.</div>

<p>Engravings, cuts, and prints will be protected,<a id="FNanchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">[1327]</a> but there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
must be at least some merit in them as artistic or instructive
productions. Thus the prints of common articles of household
use in a tradesmen's catalogue,<a id="FNanchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">[1328]</a> drawings of billiard
tables in a similar catalogue,<a id="FNanchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">[1329]</a> a card of specimen colours and
tints of zinc paints,<a id="FNanchor_1330" href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">[1330]</a> and a poster with coloured drawings of a
circus performance<a id="FNanchor_1331" href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">[1331]</a> have all been refused protection. If
there is real artistic merit in a drawing it will not be disentitled
to protection merely on the ground that it has been
used as an advertisement.<a id="FNanchor_1332" href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor">[1332]</a></p>

<p>It has been held that playing cards printed in colours are
entitled to protection as "prints."<a id="FNanchor_1333" href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor">[1333]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pictures.</div>

<p>The Act of June 18, 1874, enacts that the protection of
the Copyright Acts conferred on "engravings," "cuts," and
"prints" shall not extend to prints or labels designed to be
used for any articles of manufacture. This Act cannot be
evaded by attempting to copyright the picture or drawing
from which the label is designed. In <i>Schumacher</i> v. <i>Wogram</i><a id="FNanchor_1334" href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor">[1334]</a>
the Court refused protection under the Copyright Acts to a
picture representing a young woman holding a bouquet of
flowers intended to be reproduced on labels for cigar boxes.
The reason for refusing protection of the copyright law to
such productions is that their only real value is as a trade
mark connected with a particular article of manufacture.<a id="FNanchor_1335" href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">[1335]</a>
They are not designed in themselves to instruct or amuse. As
trade marks they will be protected if registered in the Patent
Office. The fact that a picture could be readily lithographed
and used as a label does not deprive it of copyright;<a id="FNanchor_1336" href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor">[1336]</a> it must
in order to lose its copyright have been made with the intention
of being used as a label. If the painting itself were
to be considered a label because copies might be so used,
no masterpiece would be entitled to copyright. A painting,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
engraving, or print in order to be protected must be a pictorial
representation of something and not merely a design.<a id="FNanchor_1337" href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor">[1337]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section</span> II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nationality of the Author</span>.</h3>

<p>Unfortunately the Acts of Congress are not clear as to
how far the works of foreign authors, or the works of non-residents
in the United States are protected.</p>

<p>Until 1891 the works of foreign authors not resident in
the United States were denied protection. Sec. 4971 of the
Revised Statutes ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sec. 4971. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit
the printing, publishing, importation, or sale of any book, map, chart,
dramatic or musical composition, print, cut, engraving, or photograph,
written, composed, or made by any person not a citizen of the United
States nor resident therein."<a id="FNanchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor">[1338]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>By the Act of 1891, the benefits of copyright are extended
to the citizens of foreign countries which are proclaimed
by the President as conferring reciprocal rights on
American citizens. Sec. 4971 of the Revised Statutes is
repealed. The Act of March 3, 1891, section 13, enacts&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That this Act shall only apply to a citizen or subject of a
foreign state or nation when such foreign state or nation permits to
citizens of the United States of America the benefit of copyright on
substantially the same basis as its own citizens, or when such foreign
state or nation is a party to an international agreement which provides
for reciprocity in the granting of copyright by the terms of which
agreement the United States of America may at its pleasure become a
party to such agreement. The existence of either of the conditions aforesaid
shall be determined by the President of the United States by proclamation
made from time to time as the purposes of this Act may require."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Act of March 3, 1891, section 5, amending the Revised
Statutes, sec. 4959, enacts that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... the alterations, revisions, and additions made to books by foreign
authors heretofore published, of which new editions shall appear subsequently
to the taking effect of this Act, shall be held and deemed capable
of being copyrighted as above provided for in this Act, unless they form a
part of the series in course of publication at the time this Act shall take
effect." (July 1, 1891.)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span></p>

<p>On these sections two questions seem to be left open:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(1) Is the test to be applied the nationality of (<i>a</i>) the
author, or of (<i>b</i>) the proprietor of the manuscript,
or other unpublished work, at the time of publication;
or will it satisfy the Act if (<i>c</i>) either of these persons
complies with the requisite conditions of nationality?</span>

<span class="i0">(2) Will residence in the United States or in one of the
proclaimed countries confer the privileges on one
who is not a citizen or subject of any of them?</span>
</div></div>

<p>1. It may be that it would be a sufficient compliance with
the requirements of the Act if either the author or his assignee
before publication were a citizen of the United States, or a subject
or citizen of a proclaimed country. Section 1 amending the
Revised Statutes, sec. 4952, gives the sole liberty to "the author,
inventor, designer, or proprietor, and to the executors, administrators,
or assigns of any such person." Section 13 "applies
the Act" to citizens or subjects of certain foreign states or
nations. Under the Revised Statutes, section 4971, before 1891
it was the nationality of the author alone that was considered,
and it would have been no answer to have said that the assignee
before publication was an American citizen or resident in the
United States. Perhaps in 1891 the benefit was designedly
extended to assignees before publication, who complied
with the conditions and who had taken assignments from
foreign authors who did not. On the whole, however, I am
inclined to the opinion that it will not do merely to allege that
the assignee of the uncopyrighted and unpublished work is a
citizen of the United States or a subject or citizen of one of the
proclaimed countries. It must, I think, be alleged that the author,
inventor, designer, or proprietor <i>ab initio</i> has complied with the
conditions as to nationality. By proprietor <i>ab initio</i> (and probably
this is the true meaning of "proprietor" in section 1 of
the Act of March 3, 1891<a id="FNanchor_1339" href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor">[1339]</a>), I mean one who compiles a work
by his servants or agents, for instance, a body corporate, which
cannot be said to be an "author, inventor, or designer," and
yet is entitled to the whole property in the work of its
servants as it grows up from day to day. I have not con
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>sidered
the assignee after publication. I think it must be
abundantly clear that his nationality cannot be taken as the
test, since if he took his assignment from a foreign author
who did not comply with the conditions of nationality when
the work was published, the work at the time of assignment
would have become <i>publici juris</i>. If he took his assignment
from one who complied with the conditions of nationality and
copyrighted the work, the fact of his being an alien would not
prevent him acquiring the copyright already secured.</p>

<p>2. Before 1891 residence in the United States, which was
interpreted to mean permanent residence and not merely for
the purposes of publication,<a id="FNanchor_1340" href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor">[1340]</a> was sufficient to entitle an author
to the privileges of the Copyright Acts. The provision now, under
the Act of March 3, 1891, is that the Act shall only apply to
a citizen of a foreign country which has been proclaimed.
Reading the Act strictly a foreign resident in the United States
but not a citizen thereof is excluded from protection which he
formerly had, unless he is a citizen or subject of a proclaimed
country. No doubt this was not intended to be the result
of the Act of 1891, but the words are plain and unambiguous,
and there seems no reason why they should not have effect
according to their plain meaning. <i>A fortiori</i> a foreigner resident
in, but not a subject of, one of the proclaimed countries would
not be entitled to copyright.</p>

<p>The following States have been proclaimed as fulfilling one
or other of the required conditions, and their citizens are
therefore entitled to acquire copyright in the United States in
the same way as an American citizen:</p>

</div></div>

<p>The proprietor of every copyright book or other article
must deliver (or mail within the United States) to the Librarian
of Congress a copy of every subsequent edition wherein any
substantial changes shall be made.<a id="FNanchor_1343" href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor">[1343]</a> Each volume of a book
in two or more volumes, when such volumes are published
separately, and the first one has not been issued before
July 1, 1891, and each number of a periodical is to be considered
an independent publication.<a id="FNanchor_1344" href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor">[1344]</a> The requirements of the
statute as to delivery of title and copies, and printing of notice
must therefore be complied with in the case of each volume of
a book or number of a periodical.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
</p>
<p><b>Conditions Precedent.</b>&mdash;The deposit of title and delivery of
copies as prescribed by the statutes are conditions precedent to
copyright and not merely declaratory.<a id="FNanchor_1345" href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor">[1345]</a> There is no common
law right after publication, and therefore if a work is published
without the proper formalities having been observed it becomes
<i>publici juris</i>, and any one may make what use of it he pleases.<a id="FNanchor_1346" href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor">[1346]</a>
Ignorance of the law is no excuse even although a new Act has
just been passed altering the time within which copies must be
delivered.<a id="FNanchor_1347" href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor">[1347]</a> In an action for infringement the declaration must
set out in detail a compliance with the law as to formalities,<a id="FNanchor_1348" href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor">[1348]</a>
and the burden of proof thereof is on the complainant.<a id="FNanchor_1349" href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor">[1349]</a> He
must prove the deposit of title, delivery of copies, notice of
copyright, and the date of publication. The latter is essential,
as on it depends the validity of the entry.<a id="FNanchor_1350" href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor">[1350]</a></p>

<p><b>Delivery of the Title.</b>&mdash;The copy of the title to be delivered
must be "printed," <i>i. e.</i> the characters used must be those
ordinarily used in printing, but they may be made by
hand with a pen.<a id="FNanchor_1351" href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor">[1351]</a> The work must be published within a
reasonable time after the deposit of the title-page, otherwise
the formalities will not have been complied with.<a id="FNanchor_1352" href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor">[1352]</a> Two
months' delay in mailing to the Librarian of Congress copies
of a photograph after the filing of its title is not unreasonable.<a id="FNanchor_1353" href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor">[1353]</a></p>

<p>It will not do to publish a book under a substantially
different title from that deposited. Immaterial variations in
the title, or sub-title, or complete alteration of a description
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
on the title-page will not make the deposit void. In <i>Donnelley</i>
v. <i>Ivers</i><a id="FNanchor_1354" href="#Footnote_1354" class="fnanchor">[1354]</a> the title deposited was "Over One Thousand Recipes.
The Lake Side Cook Book: A Complete Manual of Practical,
Economical, Palatable, and Healthful Cookery. Chicago:
Donnelley, Lloyd &amp; Company, 1878." The title on the book
as published was "The Lake Side Cook Book, No. 1. A
Complete Manual of Practical, Economical, Palatable, and
Healthful Cookery. By N. A. D." It was held that the requirement
as to the deposit of title having been "substantially,
in good faith complied with," the objection was not tenable.
What is required is, that the deposited title be sufficient to
identify the book with substantial certainty. In <i>Carte</i> v.
<i>Evans</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1355" href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor">[1355]</a> the title filed was "Pianoforte Arrangement of the
Comic Opera, The Mikado, or the Town of Titipu, by W. S.
Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan. By George L. Tracey." The
book as published bore the title "Vocal Score of the Mikado,
or The Town of Titipu. Arrangement for Pianoforte by
George Lowell Tracey (of Boston, U. S. A.) of the above-named
opera by W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan." This was held
a sufficient deposit to protect the pianoforte accompaniment.
In <i>Black</i> v. <i>Allen</i><a id="FNanchor_1356" href="#Footnote_1356" class="fnanchor">[1356]</a> the title deposited was "An Outline of the
Political and Economic History of the United States, with
Maps and Charts: I. History and Constitution by Alexander
Johnson, M. A.; II. Population and Industry by Francis A.
Walker, LL. D." The title of the book as deposited was
"United States: Part III. Political Geography and Statistics,
copyright, 1888, by Francis A. Walker." In the absence of
evidence that the defendant was deceived or misled by the
change of the title the Court held that it was valid. In <i>Daly</i> v.
<i>Brady</i><a id="FNanchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor">[1357]</a> the title of a drama deposited was "Under the Gaslight:
A Drama of Life and Love in these Times." The actual title
as published was "Under the Gaslight: A Romantic Panorama
of the Streets and Homes of New York." The Court held
that the change of title might deceive the public, and therefore
the deposit of title was bad; but this decision was reversed
in <i>Daly</i> v. <i>Webster</i>;<a id="FNanchor_1358" href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor">[1358]</a> the variance was in the description.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
"The title required may include a sub-title, but it does not include
a description of the book upon the title-page."</p>

<p>An author may wish to change his title entirely after he
has deposited the title-page. He may do this before the
deposit of copies by depositing a fresh title-page; but it is
questionable whether the duration of his copyright will run
from the first deposit of title or from the deposit of the altered
title.<a id="FNanchor_1359" href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor">[1359]</a></p>

<p><b>Delivery of Description.</b>&mdash;Probably a short description is
all that is required. If the title is in itself descriptive, probably
that will be sufficient. The photograph of a painting,
or other work of art which is required to be delivered, does
not take the place of a description.<a id="FNanchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor">[1360]</a></p>

<p><b>Delivery of Copies.</b>&mdash;Under the Revised Statutes before
1891 the printed copies had to be delivered "within ten days
from the publication thereof." This was sufficiently complied
with by the delivery of two copies on the day before publication.<a id="FNanchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor">[1361]</a>
The Act of 1891 now requires that the two printed
copies shall be delivered "not later than the day of publication."</p>

<p>The copies deposited with the Librarian of Congress do not
require to bear the statutory notice as to copyright.<a id="FNanchor_1362" href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor">[1362]</a></p>

<p>The memorandum given by the librarian is sufficient
<i>primâ facie</i> evidence of the fact and date of deposit.<a id="FNanchor_1363" href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor">[1363]</a> The
librarian's date stamp on the book is not conclusive, and may
be rebutted by other evidence of the actual date of deposit.<a id="FNanchor_1364" href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor">[1364]</a> If
the copyright matter is ordinarily bound up with other matter,
the Librarian of Congress cannot insist on the delivery of the
bound volume complete. It is a sufficient delivery to take the
volume to pieces and deliver the loose sheets on which the
copyright matter is printed.<a id="FNanchor_1365" href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor">[1365]</a> Before 1891 the two copies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
deposited had to be of the "best edition," but this appears to
be no longer necessary.</p>

<p><b>Printing in the United States.</b>&mdash;In the case of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">i.</span> books,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">ii.</span> chromos,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">iii.</span> lithographs,</span>
<span class="i0"><span class="rgt">iv.</span> photographs,</span>
</div></div>

<p>the two copies required to be delivered must be printed from
type set within the limits of the United States or from plates
made therefrom, or from negatives or drawings on stone
made within the limits of the United States, or from transfers
made therefrom.<a id="FNanchor_1366" href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor">[1366]</a></p>

<p>This requirement was introduced in 1891, when the
privileges of copyright were extended to subjects and citizens
of foreign countries. Formerly there was no obligation to
print within the United States.</p>

<p>It has been held that a volume of music is not a "book"
within the meaning of the provision in the statute enacting
that the two copies delivered shall be printed in the United
States.<a id="FNanchor_1367" href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor">[1367]</a> It would seem to follow that the necessity of printing
in the United States does not extend either to maps or charts,
or even to dramatic compositions in book form. These are
all dealt with specifically in the Act, and therefore, on the
authority of <i>Littleton</i> v. <i>Oliver</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1368" href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor">[1368]</a> do not come within the generic
term "books."</p>

<p><b>Retrospective Provision.</b>&mdash;By an Act of March 3, 1893,
it is enacted&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That any author, inventor, designer, or proprietor of any book or
other article entitled to copyright, who has heretofore failed to deliver in
the office of the Librarian of Congress two complete copies of such book,
or description or photograph of such article within the time limited by
title sixty, chapter three of the Revised Statutes relating to copyrights and
the Acts in amendment thereof, and has complied with all other provisions
thereof, who has before the 1st day of March 1893 delivered at the office
of Librarian of Congress or deposited in the mail addressed to the
Librarian of Congress two complete printed copies of such book, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
description or photograph of such article, shall be entitled to all the rights
and privileges of such title sixty, chapter three of the Revised Statutes
and the Acts in amendment thereof."</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Notice of Copyright.</b>&mdash;No person can maintain an action
for infringement of his copyright unless each published copy
of his work bears one or other of the following notices:<a id="FNanchor_1369" href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor">[1369]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Entered according to Act of Congress in the year &mdash;&mdash;, by A. B.,
in the office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington.</p></blockquote>

<p>Or:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Copyright, 18&mdash;, by A. B."</p></blockquote>

<p>Books must bear the notice:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On the title-page or page immediately following."<a id="FNanchor_1370" href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor">[1370]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Designs for moulded decorative articles, tiles, plaques, or
articles of pottery:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Upon the back or bottom of such articles or on such other place
upon them as it has heretofore been usual ... for the placing of manufacturers,
merchants, and trade marks thereon."<a id="FNanchor_1371" href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor">[1371]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Other works, including musical compositions, photographs,
pictures, engravings:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Upon some visible portion thereof, or of the substance upon which
the same shall be mounted."<a id="FNanchor_1372" href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor">[1372]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The statutory requirements as to notice must be strictly
complied with, and a departure from the exact words of one
or other of the alternative forms may be fatal to the right
of action. When the only notice on a book was "Entered
according to Act of Congress, in the year 1878, by H. A.
Jackson," it was held an insufficient notice as complying with
neither of the two alternative forms.<a id="FNanchor_1373" href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor">[1373]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Slight
variation.</div>

<p>A very slight variance in the words or the orders of the slight
words, if the matter is substantially the same, will not, however,
make a bad notice. Thus "1889, Copyrighted by B. J. Falk,
N. Y.," has been held a good notice.<a id="FNanchor_1374" href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor">[1374]</a> So also has "Copyright
entered according to Act of Congress, 1889, by T. C. Hefel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
civil engineer." It was held to comply with the short alternative
notice, viz.: "Copyright, 18&mdash;, by A. B.," the superfluous
words being disregarded on the doctrine of <i>utile per inutile non
vitiatur</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1375" href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor">[1375]</a></p>

<p><i>The name of the proprietor</i> who takes out the copyright is an
essential part of the notice. In <i>Osgood</i> v. <i>Aloe</i><a id="FNanchor_1376" href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor">[1376]</a> the following
notice was printed on the page following the title-page, "Copyright,
1891; all rights reserved." This was held a bad notice,
and the name of the publishers, who were also the proprietors,
printed on the title-page was insufficient. There was nothing to
show that they were proprietors as well as publishers. Copyright
may be taken out in the name of a firm or a conventional trade
name, and if that name is on the notice it is sufficient.<a id="FNanchor_1377" href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor">[1377]</a> But it
must be the full and proper name under which the proprietors
are trading. Thus when <i>The Illustrated American Publishing
Company</i> issued a paper entitled <i>The Illustrated American</i>, the
following was held an insufficient notice on a crayon drawing
published by the Company, viz.: "Copyrighted 1891, by <i>The
Illustrated American</i>."<a id="FNanchor_1378" href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor">[1378]</a> It seems, however, that it is not necessary
for an individual to give his full name if what is given is
sufficient for the purposes of identity. Thus the surname and
the first letter of the Christian name,<a id="FNanchor_1379" href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor">[1379]</a> and in one case the surname
alone have been held sufficient.<a id="FNanchor_1380" href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor">[1380]</a> The latter case was
that of a photographer in Brooklyn. It was shown that there
was only one photographer of that name in Brooklyn, and the
notice ran "Copyright, '93, by Bolles, Brooklyn."<a id="FNanchor_1381" href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor">[1381]</a> If the full
name is given there is no necessity to give the address of the
proprietor, even although he be a foreigner resident abroad.<a id="FNanchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor">[1382]</a></p>

<p>It will not do to put the name of an agent on the notice.
In <i>Nifflin</i> v. <i>Dutton</i><a id="FNanchor_1383" href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor">[1383]</a> the authoress of "The Minister's Wooing"
took out a copyright in the whole book in her own name.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
Subsequently several chapters of the story were published
serially in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>. The only notice of copyright
in that magazine was in the name of the publishers, Ticknor and
Fields. It was held that these chapters had not a sufficient
notice. Great care must be taken in the case of serial publications.
If a story is published in a magazine each part must
be treated as a separate book, and must contain a notice of
copyright by the author if he is the owner. When the book is
published as a whole these notices must be repeated; it will not
do merely to copyright the whole book afresh and print a new
notice.</p>

<p><i>Date of Entry.</i>&mdash;The date required is the year only; neither
the day nor the month is necessary. The statement of a wrong
year has been held fatal to the notice. In <i>Baker</i> v. <i>Taylor</i><a id="FNanchor_1384" href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor">[1384]</a>
the true date of taking out copyright was 1846. The notice
stated 1847 as the year, and this was held as bad notice, even
although the error arose from mistake. But in <i>Callaghan</i> v.
<i>Myers</i><a id="FNanchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">[1385]</a> the notice put an earlier instead of a later date than the
actual date of deposit; the true date being 1867, the notice
declared copyright to have been entered in 1866. This was held
an immaterial error, since it deceived no one, and would only
operate to shorten the claimant's copyright by one year. In
<i>Schumacher</i> v. <i>Wogram</i><a id="FNanchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">[1386]</a> Wallace, J., doubted whether the
declaration in the notice of a date earlier than the true date
would not make the notice void. It is immaterial that the date
on the notice is abbreviated if it is sufficiently clear what date
is meant; thus, "Copyright, '94, by A. B.," is a good notice.<a id="FNanchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">[1387]</a></p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to determine what date the law
requires to be placed upon the second or subsequent edition
of a book wherein substantial alterations or additions have been
made. In the case of a reprint, I think it is clear that the date
of the first edition, and that only, is the correct date; and even
where alterations or additions have been made I think that that
date is necessary, and I doubt whether it is necessary to add
another notice giving the date of the revised edition. It would
seem that a subsequent edition does not require to be "entered"<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
in the same manner as the original edition; the statute is complied
with by the deposit of a copy of every subsequent edition
wherein any substantial changes shall be made. If this is done
copyright in the alterations seems to have been procured. In
<i>Lawrence</i> v. <i>Dana</i><a id="FNanchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">[1388]</a> Clifford, J., held that it was not necessary in
a subsequent edition to give the date of the entry of the first
edition<a id="FNanchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">[1389]</a>; but I doubt if this is sound. On the whole, I think
the correct view is that the matter peculiar to the first edition,
whether it be printed in the first or any subsequent edition, must
bear a notice with the date when that matter was first entered,
and that the matter peculiar to any subsequent edition will be
protected until the expiry of the copyright in the first edition, if
it bears a notice with the date of the first edition only, and if a
copy has been sent to the Librarian of Congress. I further
think that the matter peculiar to subsequent editions may be
protected for the full term of twenty-eight or thirty-two years
from the date of the first publication of the edition in which it
is first contained, if such edition is separately entered, by two
copies of the title-page and of the book being deposited, and if
it bears a notice with the date of such separate entry. I think,
therefore, in every new edition in which there is a substantial
alteration or addition there should as a matter of practice be a
separate entry of copyright and separate notices on the title-page,
one for each edition of the book.</p>

<p>The question may be raised as to whether a book is a
subsequent edition or an entirely new book. In <i>Banks</i> v.
<i>M'Divitt</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">[1390]</a> the plaintiff had annotated the rules of the Supreme
Court of New York. He had published such annotated
editions in 1858 and 1871. In 1874 the rules were extensively
amended, and the plaintiff published an annotated copy.
It was held that this was not a subsequent edition of the
original annotated rules, and therefore no notice of the original
date of publication was required. I very much doubt whether
this is a sound decision. It seems to me that in so far as the
new book was the same as the old, it was a subsequent edition,
and in order to retain protection required a notice of original
publication.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
</p>
<p><i>Every published copy</i> of every edition<a id="FNanchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">[1391]</a> of a work must have
the statutory notice thereon; every proprietor who sues must
have printed the notice on every copy published by him. If
an assignee of a copyright fail to print a proper notice he will
have no remedy even against his assignor for infringement.<a id="FNanchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">[1392]</a>
From the wording of the Act of June 18, 1874, it seems that
the printing of the notice is not now a condition precedent to
copyright, but is only a condition of the right of action upon
infringement. It is, I think, questionable whether the failure
of A to print a proper notice will affect the right of B, his
assignee, to sue for an infringement subsequent to the assignment.
One who makes an unauthorised copy of a literary or
artistic work is not exempt from liability merely because he
can show that the copy from which he copied had no notice.
His defence must be that such copy left the proprietor's hands
without a proper notice.<a id="FNanchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">[1393]</a> The question has been raised, but
not answered, whether if the proprietor grant a licence, and the
licensee omits to insert a proper notice, the proprietor is without
a remedy.<a id="FNanchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">[1394]</a></p>

<p>Formerly if a book were published in several volumes at
different times, it was sufficient to place the notice on the first
volume only,<a id="FNanchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">[1395]</a> but now since the Act of 1891<a id="FNanchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">[1396]</a> each volume of
a book and each number of a periodical is to be considered an
independent publication, and the notice must be placed on
each volume or part accordingly.</p>

<p>There is no special provision in the law of the United States
as to newspapers and other periodical works, therefore each
issue must be considered a separate work, and the requisite
formalities complied with in each case.</p>

<p><i>Notice on Painting.</i>&mdash;It was contended in one case<a id="FNanchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">[1397]</a> that
there was no necessity to place the notice on an original
painting, the Act only requiring notices to be placed on copies
made therefrom. The Court held, however, that the original
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
work was a "copy" within the meaning of the provision in
the Act, and must be inscribed with the notice accordingly.</p>

<p><i>Maps in Atlas.</i>&mdash;Each map contained in an atlas does not
require to be separately copyrighted, or bear a separate notice
of copyright. They are protected by a copyright of the
entire work.<a id="FNanchor_1398" href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor">[1398]</a> The same would, no doubt, apply to a volume
of engravings or other works of art.</p>

<p><b>Publication.</b>&mdash;There appears to be some doubt as to
whether publication is necessary as a condition precedent to
the statutory rights. The duration of copyright is to be
measured from the date of the deposit of the title or description
with the Librarian of Congress; but probably that in
itself gives no proprietary right either in the title or the
book. It has been suggested that it gives an "inchoate right,"
or an "equitable right, which Chancery will protect until the
other acts may be done."<a id="FNanchor_1399" href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor">[1399]</a> It may be that when the formalities
have been completed by deposit of copies the right
then acquired dates back to the deposit of title so as to give
a statutory remedy against an infringement made between the
two dates.<a id="FNanchor_1400" href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor">[1400]</a> When the copies of the book have been deposited,
the express conditions precedent of the statute have been
performed; but the question has been raised whether there will
be copyright unless within a reasonable time thereafter the book
or other work is put in circulation among the public. In
<i>Boucicault</i> v. <i>Hart</i><a id="FNanchor_1401" href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor">[1401]</a> the Court held that although the title-page
had been filed there could be no copyright without "a
deposit of copies and publication." In <i>The Jewellers' Mercantile
Agency</i> v. <i>Jewellers' Publishing Company</i><a id="FNanchor_1402" href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor">[1402]</a> the New York Supreme
Court, on a question as to whether an action should be founded
on the Statute or at Common Law, held that although there
had been deposit of title and deposit of copies in accordance
with the Acts there could be no copyright, but only a common
law right unless there had been a "publication." In <i>Ladd</i> v.
<i>Oxnard</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1403" href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor">[1403]</a> the circuit judge, Putnam, thought that the statutory
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
right was perfected by deposit of copies, and that from then,
until "publication," there were concurrent remedies under
the Statute and at Common Law. After the decision in
<i>Ladd</i> v. <i>Oxnard</i><a id="FNanchor_1404" href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor">[1404]</a> the decision in <i>The Jewellers' Mercantile Agency</i>
v. <i>Jewellers Publishing Company</i> was reviewed by the Appeal
Court of New York.<a id="FNanchor_1405" href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor">[1405]</a> The Court was unanimous in reversing
the judgment below, and holding that the plaintiff's right of
action was a statutory right and not a common law right.
Three of the judges gave their decision on the ground
that the facts proved showed a publication subsequent to
deposit; but the other three gave it on the ground that the
deposit itself was a publication and completed the statutory
copyright. It is submitted that this latter is the correct view,
and that, therefore, after deposit of the title-page and deposit
of copies in due form nothing further is necessary to acquire
copyright.</p>

<p>Apart from the question as to whether publication is
necessary to complete the statutory right, several questions of
importance may arise on the fact or date of publication, <i>e. g.</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. The remedy at Common Law depends entirely on the
absence of publication.</span>
<span class="i0">2. The due performance of the formalities of deposit
of title and copies are relative to the date of
publication.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The essence of publication consists in a disclosure of the
thing itself, so that the public without discrimination of persons
have an opportunity of enjoying its use.<a id="FNanchor_1406" href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor">[1406]</a> The most usual
method of publication of a literary or artistic work is the
offering for sale, selling, or giving away of copies.<a id="FNanchor_1407" href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor">[1407]</a> It is not
necessary that a copy of the book be actually sold, it is
sufficient if it be offered to the public. The act of publication
is the act of the author, and cannot be dependent on the
act of the purchaser.<a id="FNanchor_1408" href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor">[1408]</a> Gratuitous distribution to members of
the public, or leaving copies in a place to which the public
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
have access, such as an hotel, is publication.<a id="FNanchor_1409" href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor">[1409]</a> The sale or
distribution of copies, however, may be so limited to individuals,
or particular classes of individuals, as not to amount
to publication. When before the advertised date of publication
an advance lot of books in quires unbound were sent
to different publishers, with a request not to publish until
bound copies should be sent, it was held, in the absence of
evidence that the request was not complied with, that there
had been no publication.<a id="FNanchor_1410" href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor">[1410]</a> The author of a literary or artistic
work may circulate it among his friends, or among a restricted
class subject to conditions, and at the same time retain his
common law right in unpublished work.<a id="FNanchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">[1411]</a> A teacher may circulate
copies of his work among the members of his class
without publishing the work.<a id="FNanchor_1412" href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor">[1412]</a> In one case a sheet of miniature
copies of engravings was sent round to picture dealers
solely for their inspection and to solicit orders. This was
held not to be a publication.<a id="FNanchor_1413" href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor">[1413]</a> Copies of an unpublished
opera given to the performers marked "Right of Representation
and Reproduction Reserved" is not a publication.<a id="FNanchor_1414" href="#Footnote_1414" class="fnanchor">[1414]</a> The
transmission of news over telegraphic instruments does not
constitute a general publication.<a id="FNanchor_1415" href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor">[1415]</a> In order to protect the
common law right the distribution of copies must be strictly
confined to individuals or to a class. If the man in the street
may buy it there is a publication even although the work
is of such a nature (<i>e. g.</i> a trade journal) as will practically be
confined to a limited class.<a id="FNanchor_1416" href="#Footnote_1416" class="fnanchor">[1416]</a> It does not make it the less a
publication that every purchaser of, or subscriber to, a literary
or artistic work is bound by restrictive conditions as to its use.
So long as the work is put within the reach of all and not
limited to a class, it matters not what conditions are imposed
on the individual subscriber.<a id="FNanchor_1417" href="#Footnote_1417" class="fnanchor">[1417]</a> Thus the sale of a book to all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
who paid for a course of instruction in a system for training
the memory was held to be a publication notwithstanding that
each sale was made under a contract not to disclose the contents
to others.<a id="FNanchor_1418" href="#Footnote_1418" class="fnanchor">[1418]</a> A book may be published although it is not
sold but issued on loan to subscribers with an express condition
that the copy must be returned on the expiry of the subscription.<a id="FNanchor_1419" href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">[1419]</a>
Publication of a book in a serial form reserving all
other rights to the author, is such a publication as to abandon
the copyright to the world, if steps have not been taken to
copyright it before such publication.<a id="FNanchor_1420" href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">[1420]</a></p>

<p>I have little doubt, but there is no definite authority, that
a book may be published so as to destroy the common law right,
although it is not printed. Circulation in manuscript would be
enough.<a id="FNanchor_1421" href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">[1421]</a></p>

<p>The public performance of a dramatic piece is not a publication
of it so as to deprive the proprietor of his common law
right in the manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_1422" href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">[1422]</a> The same rule probably applies to the
oral delivery of a lecture or sermon, unless there is some act
or circumstance from which it can be implied that the speaker
intended to abandon the literary matter to the free use of the
public.</p>

<p>It has been held by the Circuit Court of Appeals<a id="FNanchor_1423" href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">[1423]</a> that the
exhibition of a picture in a public gallery is a publication of
the picture so as to destroy the owner's rights, unless he has
taken steps to secure a copyright. One of the three judges
dissented from the judgment, but on what ground does not
appear. In a case decided by a district judge,<a id="FNanchor_1424" href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">[1424]</a> shortly before
the one just cited, the judge thought that the exhibition of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
painting in a public saloon did not work a forfeiture of the
right to obtain copyright unless the general public was permitted
to take copies at pleasure, and such permission would
not be assumed in the absence of direct evidence. The same
judge decided that neither the sale of a replica in a different size
made before the principal picture by way of a study nor the
publication of a crayon sketch in an exhibition catalogue
was a publication of the picture. It is submitted that the
exhibition of a picture in a public gallery is a publication. It
seems to afford the public an opportunity of making every
legitimate use of the contents of the picture. They could not
make any greater use of the contents if they bought an engraving
of the picture. It would not even then be lawful for
them to make copies of the picture. As to the replica and the
rough sketches in the catalogue, no doubt they were not
"copies" of the picture, and therefore their publication could
not entirely destroy the copyright in the picture; but if these
were published without being copyrighted or without statutory
notice, clearly the public could copy them, and to that extent
the copyright in the design of the original picture would have
been forfeited.</p>

<p>An unauthorised publication will not operate to forfeit the
common law rights;<a id="FNanchor_1425" href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">[1425]</a> but if authorised by the owner it is
immaterial that the publication constitutes a breach of contract
with a licensee or part assignee.<a id="FNanchor_1426" href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">[1426]</a> Thus the author of a
German unpublished play conveyed the performing rights in
the United States to a citizen of the States, and contracted with
him that he would not publish the play as a book. In breach
of this contract the play was published in Germany under the
authority of the author. It was held that such publication
destroyed all literary rights in the United States.<a id="FNanchor_1427" href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">[1427]</a> When the
defendant relies on previous publication he must definitely prove
such publication, and that it was made with the consent of the
owner.<a id="FNanchor_1428" href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">[1428]</a></p>

<p><i>The Library of Congress.</i>&mdash;All the copyright records are in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
the Library of Congress at Washington, and are kept by the
Librarian of Congress, who makes an annual report to Congress
of the number and description of copyright publications.</p>

<p>The Librarian of Congress must record the name of each
copyright work in a book kept for the purpose. The form of
entry is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Library of Congress, to wit,&mdash;Be it remembered that on the <span class="i10">day</span>
of <span class="i10">A. B.</span> of <span class="i10">,</span> hath deposited in this
office the title of a book (map, chart, or otherwise as the case may be, or
description of the article), the title or description of which is in the
following words, to wit: (here insert the title or description), the right
whereof he claims as author (originator or proprietor as the case may be),
in conformity with the laws of the United States respecting copyright.&mdash;C.
D., Librarian of Congress."</p></blockquote>

<p>The librarian must give a copy of the title or description under
the seal of the Librarian of Congress to the proprietor whenever
he requires it.</p>

<p>The Librarian of Congress is entitled to receive from the
persons to whom the services are rendered the following
fees:<a id="FNanchor_1429" href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">[1429]</a></p>

<table summary="Table of fees received by the Librarian of Congress for services rendered.">

</table>

<p>All fees so received must be paid into the Treasury of the
United States.</p>

<p>The charge for recording the title or description of the
work of a person not a citizen of, or resident in, the United
States is $1.</p>

<p>The Librarian forwards a note of the title-entries to the
Secretary of the Treasury, who must prepare and print, at
intervals of not more than a week, catalogues of such title-entries
for distribution to the collectors of customs of the
United States and to the postmasters of all post-offices
receiving foreign mails; and such weekly lists as they are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
issued are furnished to all parties desiring them at a sum not
exceeding $5 per annum.<a id="FNanchor_1430" href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">[1430]</a></p>

<p>The Secretary and Postmaster-General are empowered and
required to make and enforce such rules and regulations as
will prevent the importation into the United States of all
articles prohibited by the Copyright Acts.<a id="FNanchor_1431" href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">[1431]</a></p>

<p>The Postmaster to whom a copyright book, title, or other
article is delivered for the Librarian of Congress must, if
requested, give a receipt therefor, and when so delivered he
must mail it to its destination.<a id="FNanchor_1432" href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">[1432]</a></p>

<p>For every failure on the part of the proprietor of any
copyright to deliver or deposit in the mail either of the
published copies, or description, or photograph, the proprietor
of the copyright is liable to a penalty of $25, to be recovered
by the Librarian of Congress in the name of the United States
in an action in the nature of an action of debt in any district
court of the United States, within the jurisdiction of which
the delinquent may reside or be found.<a id="FNanchor_1433" href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">[1433]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section IV.&mdash;Immoral Works.</span></h3>

<p>A work containing immoral matter will not receive the
protection of the Courts.<a id="FNanchor_1434" href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">[1434]</a> A song containing the verse,
"She's the hottest thing you ever seen," was not protected.<a id="FNanchor_1435" href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">[1435]</a>
The introduction of obscene, profane, or libellous
matter into a literary or artistic work does not render
it <i>publici juris</i>; the copyright remains, but the Court will
not entertain any action upon it. Thus in <i>Broder</i> v.
<i>Zeno</i><a id="FNanchor_1436" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">[1436]</a> the Court said that their decision to refuse protection
would not prevent the complainants from republishing
their song, and by omitting the objectionable word thus
secure a valid copyright. If an action is brought for the
piracy of immoral matter it will be dismissed without costs
to either party. The fact that a work such as playing cards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
may, and probably will, be used for an unlawful purpose,
does not disentitle it to protection.<a id="FNanchor_1437" href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">[1437]</a> A guide to the turf has
been protected,<a id="FNanchor_1438" href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">[1438]</a> so has a list of records and trotters and
pacers.<a id="FNanchor_1439" href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">[1439]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section V.&mdash;Duration of Copyright.</span></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"Copyrights shall be granted for the term of twenty-eight years from
the time of recording the title thereof."<a id="FNanchor_1440" href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">[1440]</a></p>

<p>"The author, inventor, or designer, if he be still living, or his widow
or children if he be dead, shall have the same exclusive right continued
for the further term of fourteen years, upon recording the title of the
work or description of the article so secured a second time, and
complying with all other regulations in regard to original copyright,
within six months before the expiration of the first term: and such
persons shall, within two months from the date of said renewal, cause a
copy of the record thereof to be published in one or more newspapers
printed in the United States for the space of four weeks."<a id="FNanchor_1441" href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor">[1441]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Callaghan</i> v. <i>Myers</i><a id="FNanchor_1442" href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor">[1442]</a> it was said that if by an error the
notice of copyright on a published book bore a date prior to the
actual year of publication the result would be not that the
notice was bad, but that the term of copyright would date
from the year specified in the notice.</p>

<p>Notice that the right to obtain an extended term is not
given to the "proprietor;" therefore an employer whose
servant did literary of artistic work in his employment would
not be entitled to an extension. It seems doubtful whether
the servant in such a case, although the actual author, would
be entitled to an extension: it is thought not.</p>

<p>If the author, inventor, or designer assigns his copyright,
he does not part with his right to an extension unless this is
clearly intended by the transfer.<a id="FNanchor_1443" href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">[1443]</a> From the terms of the
statute one might doubt whether the right to obtain an
extension is assignable. No doubt a contract to assign it
would be valid, and a document purporting to assign it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
would be held equivalent to such, so that on the extension
being acquired the purchaser could compel an assignment.</p>

<p>If the author of an unpublished work conveys all right,
title, and interest in it to another, he certainly cannot take out
an extended term to run against his grantee.<a id="FNanchor_1444" href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">[1444]</a> It seems doubtful
whether he can take it out at all. Certainly his grantee cannot,
and probably the author could not for his benefit.</p>

<p>If the original term is invalid there will be no right to a
renewal.<a id="FNanchor_1445" href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">[1445]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

WHO IS THE OWNER OF THE COPYRIGHT?</h2>

<p>Under Section 4952 of the Revised Statutes as amended by
the Act of March 3, 1891, the statutory right is vested in "the
author, inventor, designer, or proprietor, and the executors,
administrators, or assigns of any such person."</p>

<p>Care must be taken in entering a copyright that it is
entered by and in the name of the owner of the common
law right in the literary or artistic work. The entry does not
require to be in the name of the author or to disclose who he
is. It must be in the name of the owner, and if entered in the
name of any other person it will be a bad entry.<a id="FNanchor_1446" href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">[1446]</a> Thus, when
a printer in his own name copyrighted a book of which he was
not the owner, he could not maintain an action either for
his own use or for the use of the owner.<a id="FNanchor_1447" href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">[1447]</a> Every action for
infringement must be brought in the name of the owner of the
copyright for the time being; and it would seem, if he is not
the author himself, he must show a derivative title from the
author.<a id="FNanchor_1448" href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">[1448]</a> The owner of a manuscript by an author unknown
would not be entitled to copyright as "proprietor" and first
publisher.<a id="FNanchor_1449" href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">[1449]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section I.&mdash;The Author.</span></h3>

<p><i>Primâ facie</i> the author is owner of the copyright. If he is
in a position of employment the right in his work may vest on
creation in his employer; or he may have contracted in such
a way that the property passes to another.<a id="FNanchor_1450" href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">[1450]</a> But some relationship
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
or contract must be shown whereby the right passes,
otherwise it remains the property of the author. The author
who does work on commission does not necessarily part with
his copyright, it may be expressly or impliedly reserved;<a id="FNanchor_1451" href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">[1451]</a>
neither does an author under a publishing agreement necessarily
convey his rights to the publisher.<a id="FNanchor_1452" href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">[1452]</a> In either case it
will depend on a construction of the contract between the
parties.</p>

<p>The author of a literary or artistic work is the man who
creates it in his mind.<a id="FNanchor_1453" href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">[1453]</a> He may employ others in the execution
of the details or in the merely manual or mechanical work
and yet remain the sole author. The author of a photograph
is the man who arranges the subject and makes choice of the
time and light. It does not make him any less the sole owner
of the work that he employs some one to take off the cap
or perform other manual details. A man who compiles a
dictionary or a directory may be the sole owner of it, although
he has had scores of employees working up the separate
parts for him.<a id="FNanchor_1454" href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">[1454]</a> But to constitute one an author he must
show that his was the "inventive" or "creative" mind; it will
not do that he has suggested a scheme and employed or
procured some one else to carry it out independently;<a id="FNanchor_1455" href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">[1455]</a> he
must by his own intellectual labour applied to the material
of his composition produce an arrangement or compilation
new in itself.<a id="FNanchor_1456" href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">[1456]</a> There may be joint authorship resulting in
co-ownership.</p>

<p>When an unpublished work or copyright belongs to two
or more persons in common, whether as co-authors or co-assignees,
either of the two may alone sue a wrongdoer,<a id="FNanchor_1457" href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor">[1457]</a> and
either may at his own expense publish the book without
accounting to his co-owner.<a id="FNanchor_1458" href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor">[1458]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section II.&mdash;The Employer.</span></h3>

<p>Probably in the case of a paid servant who does literary or
artistic work for his master in the course of his employment,
the master is the proprietor of the work even in its embryo
state, and no conveyance, transfer, or consent by or on behalf
of the servant is necessary to entitle the master to enter the
copyright in his own name as proprietor. In such a case
he does not require to show that he is the "author" of the
work; he is a proprietor, and is entitled to the copyright
as such.<a id="FNanchor_1459" href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">[1459]</a></p>

<p>In the case of work done on commission the relationship
of the parties is somewhat different. The author is not a
servant but an independent contractor, and therefore his work
does not <i>ab initio</i> vest in his employer. There is a strong presumption
in the case of a commission to execute work not in
existence at the time, that the work when executed is to belong
unreservedly to the person giving the order.<a id="FNanchor_1460" href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">[1460]</a> The question
depends, however, entirely on what the actual agreement
between the parties was.<a id="FNanchor_1461" href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">[1461]</a> An author, although he does work
on commission, may well reserve the copyright to himself,
giving to his employer a licence for a particular purpose only.<a id="FNanchor_1462" href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">[1462]</a>
If it has been agreed expressly or impliedly that the employer
is to become owner of the copyright, then the delivery of the
manuscript or other work in fulfilment of the contract will pass
the author's literary or artistic common law right to the employer,
and the latter may take the copyright in his own name
as proprietor.<a id="FNanchor_1463" href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">[1463]</a> If the term of the contract were that the
author should retain the copyright, copyright must be entered
in the author's name.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section III.&mdash;The State.</span></h3>

<p>It has been questioned whether the Government of the
United States or an individual State could take out a copyright
for itself.<a id="FNanchor_1464" href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">[1464]</a> It does seem doubtful whether the State can
<i>ab initio</i> be the proprietor of a copyright. As was pointed out
in <i>Banks</i> v. <i>Manchester</i>:<a id="FNanchor_1465" href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">[1465]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The State cannot properly be called a citizen of the United States
or a resident therein, nor could it ever be in a condition to fall within the
description in the Revised Statutes, section 4952 or section 4954."</p></blockquote>

<p>A corporation, however, has been held capable of entering
itself as the original proprietor of a copyright.<a id="FNanchor_1466" href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">[1466]</a> In the case of
<i>Heine</i> v. <i>Appleton</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1467" href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">[1467]</a> where an artist was employed on a Government
expedition to Japan on the terms that all his artistic and
scientific work should be the property of the United States
Government, and the artistic material was, with the artist's
consent, published by order of Congress in the report of the
expedition, it was said that the artistic matter had been
abandoned to the free use of the public. It does not appear,
however, whether Congress, if they had taken steps, could or
could not have secured a copyright in the literary or artistic
matter in the report. Whether or not the Government of the
United States or a State could be lawfully entered as the
original proprietors of a work, it cannot be seriously doubted
that as assignees they could acquire a copyright in matter
already copyrighted by an individual. This they would be
entitled to purchase and hold as any other Government property,
such as ships, guns, and stores. A copyright might be
taken out by an individual minister for the benefit of the
people.<a id="FNanchor_1468" href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">[1468]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section IV.&mdash;The Assignee.</span></h3>

<p>Before copyright has been secured the common law rights
in a manuscript or other unpublished work may be conveyed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
by parol; no writing or evidence in writing is required.<a id="FNanchor_1469" href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor">[1469]</a> If a
publisher takes a copyright in his own name with the knowledge
and acquiescence of the author, the publisher is the
lawful owner of the copyright subject to his accounting to the
author in terms of the contract between them.<a id="FNanchor_1470" href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">[1470]</a> Under the
Act of 1831, and until the Revised Statutes, 1874, were passed,
it would seem that a manuscript could not be assigned except
by writing.<a id="FNanchor_1471" href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">[1471]</a> Although the common law exclusive right of
first production may pass by parol or delivery, it does not
necessarily pass with possession or even with the ownership of
the manuscript or other work. An author or other proprietor
may sell documents, pictures, or other literary or artistic
articles, reserving to himself the right of publication and right
to acquire copyright and subsequently multiply copies.<a id="FNanchor_1472" href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">[1472]</a> If an
author's manuscripts are sold in execution, the purchaser does
not acquire the right of publication.</p>

<p>After copyright has been secured the assignment is governed
by statute. Section 4955 of the Revised Statutes, 1874, provides
that copyrights are assignable in law by any instrument in
writing, and such assignment must be recorded in the office of
the Librarian of Congress within sixty days after its execution;
in default of which it is void as against any subsequent
purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration without
notice.</p>

<p>It must be considered at least doubtful whether this section
affects a question between the parties or between the assignee
and one who does not claim through the assignor.<a id="FNanchor_1473" href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">[1473]</a> Mr.
Drone, in his work on copyright, expresses an opinion that the
first part of the section is merely permissive, and intended to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
show that if the assignment is in writing no formalities are
required. I doubt if this is sound. I think that even as
between assignor and the assignee the assignment must be in
writing; but I think the assignee can, without recording the
assignment, sue his assignor or any third person, except those
who claim a title through the assignor.</p>

<p>An agreement to assign may be made by parol, and where
there was no subsequent assignment in proper form damages
could be recovered for breach of the agreement.<a id="FNanchor_1474" href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">[1474]</a></p>

<p>Any alien friend may be an assignee of a copyright in the
United States.<a id="FNanchor_1475" href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">[1475]</a></p>

<p>The assignee appears to take with the copyright an assignment
of the assignor's choses in action; he has been held
entitled to sue in respect of infringements committed prior to
assignment.<a id="FNanchor_1476" href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">[1476]</a></p>

<p>An assignment need not necessarily be made by conveying
the author's entire right to one person. It may be conveyed
to two or more persons in common, or an undivided interest
may be conveyed to one or more persons.<a id="FNanchor_1477" href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">[1477]</a> We have seen
that the statutory right of reproduction is divisible from the
right of property in the concrete work.<a id="FNanchor_1478" href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">[1478]</a> Thus an author may
sell his painting or manuscript and retain the right to multiply
copies. Further, the various rights of copyright may be split
up as the holder pleases;<a id="FNanchor_1479" href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">[1479]</a> one may have the right of printing,
another the right of translating, and a third the right of performing.
The assignment may also be limited as to a particular
country or countries,<a id="FNanchor_1480" href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">[1480]</a> the right to perform or print in America
may be given to A, and the right to perform or print in Great
Britain to B. Probably an assignment cannot be limited to
a portion of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_1481" href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">[1481]</a> I do not think that a copyright
could be assigned for a limited time.<a id="FNanchor_1482" href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">[1482]</a></p>

<p>As a rule a licensee cannot sue in respect of an infringement;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
but a licensee has been held the proper party to sue
when he was an exclusive licensee, and by the terms of his
licence was to bring all necessary suits.<a id="FNanchor_1483" href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">[1483]</a> Copyright passes by
bequest or on intestacy to the executors or administrators of
the owner.<a id="FNanchor_1484" href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">[1484]</a> On bankruptcy the bankrupt's copyrights may be
applied for the benefit of the estate; but it would probably be
necessary for the Court to order a transfer in conformity with
the requirements of the Copyright Acts.<a id="FNanchor_1485" href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">[1485]</a> Probably a bankrupt's
manuscripts and other private matter could not be
published for the benefit of the estate without the consent of
the bankrupt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

INFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT</h2>

<p>The exclusive right given by the statute is "the sole liberty of
printing, reprinting, publishing, completing, copying, executing,
finishing, and vending ... and, in the case of a dramatic
composition, of publicly performing or representing it or causing
it to be performed or represented by others; and authors or
their assigns shall have exclusive right to dramatize and
translate any of their works for which copyright shall have
been obtained under the laws of the United States."<a id="FNanchor_1486" href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">[1486]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section I.&mdash;What is a Piratical Copy.</span></h3>

<p>A copy of a literary or artistic work is such a reproduction
of the original as will serve in whole or in part as a substitute
for the original. Thus the plate from which a piratical engraving
is intended to be struck is not a copy of the original
engraving amounting to an infringement.<a id="FNanchor_1487" href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">[1487]</a> Neither when
several stones are required to produce a lithograph is an
impression of the first stone only giving a mere outline an
infringement.<a id="FNanchor_1488" href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">[1488]</a> But a lithograph may be an infringement of a
photograph if it produces the general conception even although
the artistic detail and peculiar merit of the photograph are not
reproduced.<a id="FNanchor_1489" href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">[1489]</a> It has also been held that a photograph may be
infringed by the design thereof being stamped on leather for a
chair seat.<a id="FNanchor_1490" href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">[1490]</a> A perforated scroll used for a mechanical musical
instrument, such as a pianola or æolian, is not a piratical copy
of the original music.<a id="FNanchor_1491" href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">[1491]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
</p>

<p>It is equally an infringement to make copies of a copyright
work for a private distribution as it is to make them for sale.<a id="FNanchor_1492" href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">[1492]</a>
Strictly, even a single copy made for private use would be an
infringement.</p>

<p><b>Copying may be Indirect.</b>&mdash;A piratical taking need not necessarily
be made direct from an authorised copy of the work alleged
to be infringed. It may be taken from a derivative work, for
instance, a painting may be infringed by copying an engraving
made from it;<a id="FNanchor_1493" href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">[1493]</a> or it may be taken from another unauthorised
work. It would seem that it is not considered an infringement
of copyright to publish and sell copies taken from the work
before it was copyrighted, even although published and sold
after it was copyrighted.<a id="FNanchor_1494" href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">[1494]</a> It might be a breach of contract or
common law right.</p>

<p><b>The Intention need not be Bad.</b>&mdash;There is no necessity for
the plaintiff in an action for infringement to show either that
the defendant when he took the matter knew that it was protected
by copyright, or that he believed the use which he was
making of the plaintiff's work was an unfair one.<a id="FNanchor_1495" href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">[1495]</a> The defendant
may have been equally ignorant of fact and law, and
yet he will be responsible for the result of his actions. Conversely,
if in fact the defendant has not made an unfair use of
the plaintiff's copyright work, it is immaterial to show either
that he thought he was infringing the plaintiff's copyright or
that he intended to carry his work further and actually to
infringe the plaintiff's rights.<a id="FNanchor_1496" href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">[1496]</a> The intention of the defendant,
however, may be material as evidence in a doubtful case.<a id="FNanchor_1497" href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">[1497]</a></p>

<p><b>Proof of Copying.</b>&mdash;The onus of proving an infringement
is on the party making the charge.<a id="FNanchor_1498" href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">[1498]</a> Mere similarity is not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
sufficient; he must show that the work charged as a piracy was
taken from his copyright work. The strongest evidence is
usually in the coincidence of errors; but a few solitary instances
are not conclusive. In a question between the authors
of two rival law works,<a id="FNanchor_1499" href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">[1499]</a> it was held that the duplication of a
few errors in citations was not sufficient evidence of piracy
where there was obviously a great deal of further work and
labour expended in the preparation of the alleged infringing
work. In a question of an alleged infringing digest,<a id="FNanchor_1500" href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">[1500]</a> it was
held that the mere verbal identity of the summary of one case
where a large number of cases had been digested was not
sufficient proof.</p>

<p><b>No Monopoly in Subject-Matter.</b>&mdash;The right of copyright
is an exclusive right of reproducing the whole or any part of
an original literary or artistic work. It differs from a right of
patent in that it does not prohibit another from producing and
reproducing a work identically the same as the protected work,
provided that he does so by going to the common sources of
information and not by copying the protected work. Copyright
creates no monopoly in the subject-matter. One man may
compile tables of shipping and railway statistics; another may,
without infringing the former's copyright, collect the same
material and work it up for himself, producing, if accurately
done and on the same principle, a very similar result.<a id="FNanchor_1501" href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">[1501]</a> In the
same way arithmetics,<a id="FNanchor_1502" href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">[1502]</a> translations,<a id="FNanchor_1503" href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">[1503]</a> school grammars,<a id="FNanchor_1504" href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">[1504]</a> maps
of a particular country,<a id="FNanchor_1505" href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">[1505]</a> biographies,<a id="FNanchor_1506" href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">[1506]</a> lithographs,<a id="FNanchor_1507" href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">[1507]</a> law books,<a id="FNanchor_1508" href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">[1508]</a>
and other works<a id="FNanchor_1509" href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor">[1509]</a> do not entitle their author to say to a subsequent
worker in the same field that as he was there first he
has a right to exclude others from competition. In one case<a id="FNanchor_1510" href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">[1510]</a>
it was attempted to set up a monopoly in the biography of
President Garfield, on the ground that the President had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
selected a particular person for the work. The contention
was rejected by the Court. Probably the only case in which
an argument in favour of monopoly in a certain subject-matter
has been sustained is that of <i>Thomas</i> v. <i>Lennox</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1511" href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">[1511]</a> The subject
of the action was Gounod's Oratorio <i>The Redemption</i>. A pianoforte
arrangement had been published without acquiring copyright,
but the orchestral score had never been published. The
defendants procured a composer to compose an orchestral
score from the pianoforte arrangement. This they publicly
performed. In an action for infringement of the common law
right in the plaintiff's unpublished orchestral score, the Court, in
granting an injunction, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In this respect an opera is more like a patented invention than a
common book; he who shall obtain similar results, better or worse, by
similar means, though the opportunity is furnished by an unprotected
book, should be held to infringe the rights of the composer."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is almost certain that this is bad law;<a id="FNanchor_1512" href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">[1512]</a> it is contrary to
the whole principle of copyright, and there is no substantial
reason why an exception should be made in favour of a musical
adaptation and not in that of a map or any other literary or
musical work.</p>

<p><b>Taking a Substantial Part.</b>&mdash;In <i>Lawrence</i> v. <i>Dana</i>, Clifford,
J., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Copying is not confined to literal repetition, but includes also the
various modes in which the matter of any publication may be adopted,
imitated, or transferred, with more or less colourable alterations to disguise
the source from which the material was derived; nor is it necessary that
the whole, or even the larger portion of the work, should be taken in order
to constitute an invasion of copyright."<a id="FNanchor_1513" href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">[1513]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Folsom</i> v. <i>Marsh</i>, Story, J., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If so much is taken that the value of the original is sensibly diminished,
or the labours of the original author are substantially, to an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
injurious extent, appropriated by another, that is sufficient in point of law
to constitute a piracy <i>pro tanto</i>. The entirety of the copyright is the property
of the author, and it is no defence that another person has appropriated
a part and not the whole of any property."<a id="FNanchor_1514" href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">[1514]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To constitute an infringement there must be a taking of a
material part of the original matter from another's work.<a id="FNanchor_1515" href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">[1515]</a> To
determine what is a material part is often a question of extreme
difficulty and nicety. It depends on the quantity and quality
of the matter taken, the object with which it is taken, the relation
of the works to one another, the proportion of the matter
taken to the complete works, but more particularly to the work
of the borrower, the extent to which the work borrowed from
is injured, and the extent to which the borrower makes profit
from the introduction of the borrowed matter.<a id="FNanchor_1516" href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor">[1516]</a> In the
case of <i>Morrison</i> v. <i>Pettibone</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1517" href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">[1517]</a> a district judge held that the
taking of the mere outline of a copyright photograph was not
a copying within the meaning of the statutes. In this case it
had been intended by the defendant to make an entire reproduction
of the photograph by the process of lithography. The
stones were all in actual readiness, but only one had been used,
giving the initial colour and exterior lines of the intended
lithograph. In one case where a few references had been
taken by the author of one law book from another, a preliminary
injunction was refused on the ground of small amount.<a id="FNanchor_1518" href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">[1518]</a>
The alleged infringement of a copyright photograph need not,
however, be substantially identical in order to ensure conviction;
it is sufficient if a substantial portion of the main design,
distinctive ideas, or characteristic features are taken.<a id="FNanchor_1519" href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">[1519]</a> Taking
the boundaries of townships from a copyright map has been
held to be an infringement.<a id="FNanchor_1520" href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">[1520]</a> The taking of a single scene from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
the drama of another may be an infringement.<a id="FNanchor_1521" href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">[1521]</a> It is no
answer to an action for infringement to say that the defendant's
book in no way rivals or competes with the plaintiff's work.<a id="FNanchor_1522" href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">[1522]</a>
That is merely a question of damages.</p>

<p><b>Fair Use.</b>&mdash;Although a man is not permitted to take the
whole or part of another's work in the compilation of his own,
he is entitled to make of that other's work what is known as a
"fair use," for the purpose of a new work. One may use
another's book as a guide to authorities;<a id="FNanchor_1523" href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">[1523]</a> for supplying suggestions
as to treatment of a subject;<a id="FNanchor_1524" href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">[1524]</a> and for the purpose of
checking the accuracy<a id="FNanchor_1525" href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">[1525]</a> of a completed work. One may use
it as a storehouse of information; but in a rival work it will be
an infringement to take any of the facts as arranged, or to take
any of the language of the other's book, except for the purposes
of criticism.</p>

<p>Shipman, J., says in <i>Banks</i> v. <i>M'Divitt</i>:<a id="FNanchor_1526" href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">[1526]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I do not understand that the rule prohibits an examination of previous
works by the compiler before he has finished his own book, or the mere
obtaining of ideas from such previous works.</p>

<p>"It may be laid down as the clear result of the authorities in cases
of this nature that the true test of piracy or not is to ascertain whether
the defendant has in fact used the plan, arrangements, and illustrations
of the plaintiff as the model of his own book with colourable alterations
and variations only to disguise the use thereof; or whether his work
is the result of his own labour, skill, and use of common materials and
common sources of knowledge open to all men, and the resemblances
are either accidental or arising from the nature of the subject."<a id="FNanchor_1527" href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">[1527]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A dramatist must not take the plot, the characters, the

The compiler of a digest must not borrow verbatim from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>

position of his towns and boundaries from a copyright map.<a id="FNanchor_1532" href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor">[1532]</a>
The compiler of a dictionary must not take his definitions
from another's copyright dictionary.<a id="FNanchor_1533" href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor">[1533]</a> The writer of a law book
must not take his citations and references from the work of
another.<a id="FNanchor_1534" href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor">[1534]</a> It is no answer to a charge of infringement for
the defendant to say he could have produced the same result
with a little extra trouble. He is not thereby entitled to
appropriate the plaintiff's labours.<a id="FNanchor_1535" href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor">[1535]</a> A man may take ideas
from the work of another and put his own material into a
similar form.<a id="FNanchor_1536" href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor">[1536]</a> If one man writes a book on physiognomy on
a new system, another may adopt his system and from his

The sketch of a detective which was said to convey an original

tradesman may not copy his circular he may adopt the
same system and issue a catalogue of his own, describing the
system in his own words.<a id="FNanchor_1540" href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor">[1540]</a> There is no infringement of a
drama in adopting from it a mechanical contrivance, such as a
tank filled with water to represent a river on the stage.<a id="FNanchor_1541" href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor">[1541]</a> In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
the case of <i>Bullinger</i> v. <i>MacKay</i><a id="FNanchor_1542" href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor">[1542]</a> it is suggested by Benedict,
J., in his judgment that there might be copyright in a novel
system of arranging matter in a statistical work. It is submitted
that this is wrong, and that even if the arrangement
was an original one there would be no infringement in taking
the method of arrangement and applying it independently.</p>

<p><b>Improvement no Excuse.</b>&mdash;It is no answer to an action
for infringement for the defendant to say that he has made
a good work out of a bad one, and so benefited the literary
or artistic world.<a id="FNanchor_1543" href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor">[1543]</a> Even although I correct errors and make
necessary additions so as to create from a worthless a useful
book, I am not entitled so to deal with another author's
work without his permission. Good or bad, an author is
entitled to do what he likes with his own work and to prevent
others making an unfair use of his labours.<a id="FNanchor_1544" href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor">[1544]</a></p>

<p><b>Different Object.</b>&mdash;When a subsequent book is written with
a different object from a previous publication it may be
legitimate to take considerable extracts from the earlier work.
To what extent this will be permitted must depend upon the
relative value of the matter taken, and the purpose for which it
is taken.<a id="FNanchor_1545" href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor">[1545]</a> It is not an absolute answer to an action for infringement
to say that the matter was taken for an entirely
different purpose from that for which it was used in the original
work. If the taking in any way supersedes the uses to which
the matter taken might have been put by its original author
there is an infringement.<a id="FNanchor_1546" href="#Footnote_1546" class="fnanchor">[1546]</a> Thus where the main design of a
photograph was reproduced on stamped leather,<a id="FNanchor_1547" href="#Footnote_1547" class="fnanchor">[1547]</a> and where the
author of a life of Garfield for the young borrowed largely
from a biography of Garfield written for political campaigns,<a id="FNanchor_1548" href="#Footnote_1548" class="fnanchor">[1548]</a>
there was held to be infringement. It is the nature and value
of the extracts more than their length or number that must
determine whether it was legitimate to take them or not.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
</p>
<p>In <i>Gray</i> v. <i>Russell</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1549" href="#Footnote_1549" class="fnanchor">[1549]</a> Story, J., says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>Non numerantur, ponderantur</i>; the quintessence of a work may be
piratically extracted so as to leave a mere <i>caput mortuum</i>, by a selection of
all the important passages in a comparatively moderate space."</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Extract for Review.</b>&mdash;Extracts may be taken from a work
for the purpose of reviewing or criticising it, or writing a
treatise in answer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Reviewers may make extracts sufficient to show the merits or demerits
of the work, but they cannot so exercise the privilege as to supersede the
original work. Sufficient may be taken to give a correct view of the
whole; but the privilege of making extracts is limited to those objects,
and cannot be exercised to such an extent that the review shall become a
substitute for the book reviewed."<a id="FNanchor_1550" href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor">[1550]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A reviewer must not tear the heart out of a book.</p>

<p><b>Abridgments.</b>&mdash;What is called a <i>bonâ fide</i> abridgment is
held to be a fair use of another's work.<a id="FNanchor_1551" href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor">[1551]</a> The opinions of the
judges in the older cases were derived from the English case
law on the subject. I think it is doubtful whether the English
abridgment cases would now be sustained, as the principle
involved is clearly against all the more recent doctrines as to
infringement. In America, however, the judges, although disagreeing
more or less with the case law as to abridgment, have
felt themselves bound by precedent to hold that a fair abridgment
is not a piracy.</p>

<p>In <i>Story</i> v. <i>Holcombe</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1552" href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor">[1552]</a> M'Lean, J., said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If this was an open question, I should feel little difficulty in determining
it. An abridgment should contain an epitome of the work
abridged&mdash;the principles in the condensed form of an original book. Now
it would be difficult to maintain that such a work did not affect the sale
of the book abridged. The argument that the abridgment is suited to a
different class of readers by its cheapness, and will be purchased on that
account by persons unable and unwilling to purchase the work at large, is
not satisfactory. This to some extent may be true, but are there not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
many who are able to buy the original work who will be satisfied with the
abridgment.... The reasoning on which the right to abridge is founded
therefore seems to me to be false in fact. It does to some extent in all
cases, and not unfrequently to a great extent, impair the rights of the author&mdash;a
right secured by law.... But a contrary doctrine has been long
established in England under the Statute of Anne, which in this respect is
similar to our own Statute, and in this country the same doctrine has
prevailed. I am therefore bound by precedent, and I yield to it in this
instance more as a principle of law than a rule of reason or justice."<a id="FNanchor_1553" href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor">[1553]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In <i>Lawrence</i> v. <i>Dana</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1554" href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor">[1554]</a> Clifford, J., took a similar view:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Whatever might be thought, if the question was an open one, it is too
late to agitate it at the present time, as the rule is settled that the publication
of an unauthorised but <i>bonâ fide</i> abridgment or digest of a published
literary copyright, in a certain class of cases at least, is no infringement of
the original."</p></blockquote>

<p>The learned judge then lays down some restriction on the
free right to abridge:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Unless it be denied that a legal copyright secures to the author 'the
sole right and liberty of printing, reprinting, publishing, and binding the
book' copyrighted, it cannot be held that an abridgment or digest of
any kind of the contents of the copyrighted publication, which is of a
character to supersede the original work, is not an infringement of the
franchise secured by the copyright. What constitutes a fair and <i>bonâ fide</i>
abridgment in the sense of law is, or may be, under particular circumstances,
one of the most difficult questions which can well arise for judicial
consideration; but it is well settled that a mere selection or different
arrangement of parts of the original work into a smaller compass will not
be held to be such an abridgment."<a id="FNanchor_1555" href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor">[1555]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I think that to-day the Courts in America as well as
England would, if the question of abridgments were to come
before them, cut down the right of the abridger very considerably.
I could not advise any one that he was safe in making
an abridgment of another's work; certainly he must avoid
making any extracts from the work abridged; the use of any
of the author's language literally or colourably taken would
undoubtedly be piratical.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
</p>
<p><b>Translations.</b>&mdash;Authors and their assigns have the exclusive
right of translating their works into any language.<a id="FNanchor_1556" href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor">[1556]</a> Before
1891 the translating right had to be expressly reserved by the
author, presumably by notice printed on every published copy
of his work.<a id="FNanchor_1557" href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor">[1557]</a> No reservation is now required. Before 1870
there was no exclusive right of translation at all.<a id="FNanchor_1558" href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor">[1558]</a> The same
remarks apply to the right of dramatization. The right of
dramatization probably does not prevent a stranger from making
a dramatic version for his own private use; but it would prohibit
any public use of such a version whether by publication
in print or representation on the stage.</p>

<p><b>Dramatic Performing Right.</b>&mdash;In the case of dramatic
works the author and his assigns have the sole right of performing
the same in public.<a id="FNanchor_1559" href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor">[1559]</a> This right was first given by Act
of Congress in 1856.<a id="FNanchor_1560" href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor">[1560]</a> In <i>Daly</i> v. <i>Palmer</i>,<a id="FNanchor_1561" href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor">[1561]</a> Blatchford, J.,
defines the scope of the Act:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A composition, in the sense in which that word is used in the Act of
1856, is a written or literary work invented or set in order. A dramatic
composition is such a work in which the narrative is not related, but is
represented by dialogue and action. When a dramatic composition is
represented in dialogue and action by persons who represent it as real by
performing or going through with the various parts or characters assigned
to them severally, the composition is acted, performed, or represented;
and if the representation is in public, it is a public representation. To act
in the sense of the Statute is to represent as real by countenance, voice, or
gesture that which is not real. A character in a play who goes through
with a series of events on the stage without speaking, if such be his part
in the play, is none the less an actor in it than one who, in addition to
motions and gestures, uses his voice. A pantomime is a species of
theatrical entertainment, in which the whole action is represented by
gesticulation without the use of words. A written work consisting wholly
of directions, set in order for conveying the ideas of the author on a stage
or public place by means of characters who represent the narrative wholly
by action is as much a dramatic composition designed or suited for public
representation as if language or dialogue were used in it to convey some
of the ideas."<a id="FNanchor_1562" href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor">[1562]</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span></p>

<p>It will be an infringement of performing right to take a
single scene from another's drama.<a id="FNanchor_1563" href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor">[1563]</a> It is more important to
consider what is a dramatic representation than what is a
dramatic composition. If a composition not primarily intended
for representation is publicly represented without permission,
even if it was not a "dramatic composition," the
person representing will be liable for having dramatized it if
the representation is dramatic. There can be a dramatic
representation by one actor only, and many music hall songs
are undoubtedly dramatically represented.</p>

<p><b>Musical Rights.</b>&mdash;Before 1897 there was no exclusive
performing right in musical compositions as such. It might
have been protected from performance if it could be shown to
be part of a dramatic piece.<a id="FNanchor_1564" href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor">[1564]</a> By the Act of January 6, 1897,
performing right in musical compositions was first created.
The protection is now substantially the same as in the case of
dramatic pieces.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section II.&mdash;Prohibited Acts, and Remedies.</span></h3>

<p>It is an infringement, subject to the remedies stated below,

<p>One-half of the penalties under the Act of March 2, 1895,
go to the proprietor of the copyright and the other half to the
use of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_1567" href="#Footnote_1567" class="fnanchor">[1567]</a></p>

<p>A series of sheets containing tabulated information has

<p>Damages cannot be recovered in a suit in equity, the
remedy being limited to an injunction and profits.<a id="FNanchor_1571" href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor">[1571]</a></p>

<p><b>Account of Profits.</b>&mdash;The right to an account of profits is
an equitable remedy, and incidental to the statutory right,
although not expressly conferred by the statute.<a id="FNanchor_1572" href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor">[1572]</a></p>

<p>If a work is in part piratical and in part innocent, then if the
piratical part can be distinctly separated it will be separately
condemned and the profits apportioned.<a id="FNanchor_1573" href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor">[1573]</a> If the piratical
matter is so mixed up with the rest that it cannot be distinctly
separated, the profits awarded will be the whole profits on the
sale of the book.<a id="FNanchor_1574" href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor">[1574]</a> When the defendant has sold a book twice,
having bought it back second-hand, the profits include
the profits on both sales.<a id="FNanchor_1575" href="#Footnote_1575" class="fnanchor">[1575]</a> The cost of producing copies
which the defendant did not sell cannot be estimated in reduction
of profits.<a id="FNanchor_1576" href="#Footnote_1576" class="fnanchor">[1576]</a> There will be no decree for profits unless
there are means of determining in a reliable manner what sum
the defendant received for books.<a id="FNanchor_1577" href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor">[1577]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
</p>
<p><b>Damages.</b>&mdash;Damages may be awarded in lieu of or as
supplementary to an account of profits. The measure of
damages is the diminution in the plaintiff's sales due to the
publication of the defendant's book.</p>

<p>The minimum statutory damages given for infringement of
performing rights are remedial but not penal, and the strict rules
of evidence in criminal cases do not apply.<a id="FNanchor_1578" href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor">[1578]</a> The penalties
given for infringement of maps, &amp;c., are of a penal nature.<a id="FNanchor_1579" href="#Footnote_1579" class="fnanchor">[1579]</a></p>

<p>In respect of maps, musical and dramatic compositions,
works of art, &amp;c., there is no right of action to recover damages
merely as such; the remedy is limited to the prescribed forfeiture
and penalties.<a id="FNanchor_1580" href="#Footnote_1580" class="fnanchor">[1580]</a></p>

<p><b>Penalties.</b>&mdash;Penalty for "each sheet" does not mean for
each copy. Where a large number of lithograph copies of a
photograph were printed on one sheet it was held that only
one penalty was recoverable for the whole sheet.<a id="FNanchor_1581" href="#Footnote_1581" class="fnanchor">[1581]</a> Cutting up
or binding the sheets does not increase nor diminish the
number of the sheets.<a id="FNanchor_1582" href="#Footnote_1582" class="fnanchor">[1582]</a> Only those sheets which are "found in
the defendant's possession" are penalised.<a id="FNanchor_1583" href="#Footnote_1583" class="fnanchor">[1583]</a> They must be alleged
and proved to have been actually discovered in the defendant's
possession before the bringing of the action,<a id="FNanchor_1584" href="#Footnote_1584" class="fnanchor">[1584]</a> and not merely
be found by the jury to have been in his possession. They
need not necessarily have been found by the plaintiff or any
one acting on his behalf.<a id="FNanchor_1585" href="#Footnote_1585" class="fnanchor">[1585]</a> An employee who holds possession
for his master is not liable in penalties.<a id="FNanchor_1586" href="#Footnote_1586" class="fnanchor">[1586]</a> Penalties cannot be
recovered in a suit in equity.<a id="FNanchor_1587" href="#Footnote_1587" class="fnanchor">[1587]</a></p>

<p><b>Forfeiture.</b><a id="FNanchor_1588" href="#Footnote_1588" class="fnanchor">[1588]</a>&mdash;It seems doubtful whether the forfeiture of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
copies of a book under section 4964 of the Revised Statutes can
be enforced unless the whole book is copied. It was held under
the Act of 1831 that they could not,<a id="FNanchor_1589" href="#Footnote_1589" class="fnanchor">[1589]</a> but I doubt if this is sound.</p>

<p>The statutes give no right of action to the proprietor of a
map, photograph, dramatic or musical work, artistic work, &amp;c.,
to recover from an infringer the value of copies which have
passed from his possession.<a id="FNanchor_1590" href="#Footnote_1590" class="fnanchor">[1590]</a></p>

<p><b>Injunction.</b><a id="FNanchor_1591" href="#Footnote_1591" class="fnanchor">[1591]</a>&mdash;A preliminary injunction is granted, but only
in a plain case,<a id="FNanchor_1592" href="#Footnote_1592" class="fnanchor">[1592]</a> to stay further damage. The Court will
always consider which party is likely to suffer most from the
erroneous granting or refusing of an injunction. In doubtful
cases an injunction will not be granted simpliciter, but the
defendants may be required to keep an account and give a
bond to answer damages.<a id="FNanchor_1593" href="#Footnote_1593" class="fnanchor">[1593]</a> An injunction will go at the hearing
without reference to the question of special damage.<a id="FNanchor_1594" href="#Footnote_1594" class="fnanchor">[1594]</a></p>

<p><b>Who is Liable.</b>&mdash;The sale of a play with a view to unauthorised
representation makes the seller a joint infringer of
the performing right.<a id="FNanchor_1595" href="#Footnote_1595" class="fnanchor">[1595]</a> The manager of a company is not
personally liable for an infringement made by the company
without his knowledge and against his express instructions.<a id="FNanchor_1596" href="#Footnote_1596" class="fnanchor">[1596]</a>
A company is liable in penalties as well as an individual.<a id="FNanchor_1597" href="#Footnote_1597" class="fnanchor">[1597]</a>
The printer and publisher of a piratical book are liable equally
with the writer.<a id="FNanchor_1598" href="#Footnote_1598" class="fnanchor">[1598]</a> One who procures an infringement to be
made is liable.<a id="FNanchor_1599" href="#Footnote_1599" class="fnanchor">[1599]</a></p>

<p>An employer whose servants or agents infringe the copyright
of others is undoubtedly liable in damages for the wrongful
acts of his servants done in the course of their employment.
Thus one who compiles a directory is responsible for the
piratical acts of his canvassers, even although they acted contrary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
to his express instructions.<a id="FNanchor_1600" href="#Footnote_1600" class="fnanchor">[1600]</a> But it has been held that a
man is not liable for forfeitures or penalties on account of acts
done without his knowledge or consent by his servants or
agents in his employment. When an agent had full authority
to advertise his principal's teas as he thought fit and pirated
some election statistics in doing so, it was held that his
principal could not be liable in forfeitures or penalties for acts
done in his absence and without his authority or knowledge.<a id="FNanchor_1601" href="#Footnote_1601" class="fnanchor">[1601]</a>
In another case it was held that the proprietor of a newspaper
was not responsible in forfeiture or penalties for a piratical
copy of a map which appeared in his newspaper during his
absence from the management and control.<a id="FNanchor_1602" href="#Footnote_1602" class="fnanchor">[1602]</a> It will be
observed that if these cases are sound the proprietor of the
copyright in a map, &amp;c., or artistic work has no remedy in
either penalties or damages against the proprietor of an infringing
publication unless he can show that the piratical
matter was inserted with his knowledge or consent. This
follows from the above decisions that the specific penalties constitute
the only remedy by way of damages which the proprietor
of these works can recover.<a id="FNanchor_1603" href="#Footnote_1603" class="fnanchor">[1603]</a></p>

<p><b>Limitation of Action.</b>&mdash;No action can be maintained in
any case of forfeiture or penalty under the copyright laws
unless the same is commenced within two years after the cause
of action has arisen.<a id="FNanchor_1604" href="#Footnote_1604" class="fnanchor">[1604]</a> This includes all claims, not only those
for forfeiture and penalty so-called, but for damages under
Revised Statutes, sec. 4964, in respect of books.<a id="FNanchor_1605" href="#Footnote_1605" class="fnanchor">[1605]</a></p>

<p><b>Acquiescence.</b>&mdash;Mere delay on the part of the plaintiff in
pursuing his remedy is no defence to an action for infringement.<a id="FNanchor_1606" href="#Footnote_1606" class="fnanchor">[1606]</a>
A preliminary injunction may be refused on the ground
of delay. The remedy on the final hearing will not be barred
by laches or acquiescence, unless it is tantamount to fraud for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
the plaintiff to insist on his legal rights.<a id="FNanchor_1607" href="#Footnote_1607" class="fnanchor">[1607]</a> A right may perhaps
be abandoned by allowing numerous members of the public to
exercise it without licence or objection.<a id="FNanchor_1608" href="#Footnote_1608" class="fnanchor">[1608]</a></p>

<p><b>Pleading.</b>&mdash;In pleading, the plaintiff does not have to allege
the facts which make him proprietor.<a id="FNanchor_1609" href="#Footnote_1609" class="fnanchor">[1609]</a> If it is disputed, it is for
the defendant to allege and prove facts to the contrary.<a id="FNanchor_1610" href="#Footnote_1610" class="fnanchor">[1610]</a> The
plaintiff, however, must allege specifically a compliance with the
statutory formalities, although he need not allege that publication
took place within a reasonable time after the deposit of the
title.<a id="FNanchor_1611" href="#Footnote_1611" class="fnanchor">[1611]</a></p>

<p>In all actions arising under the laws respecting copyrights,
the defendant may plead the general issue, and give the special
matter in evidence.<a id="FNanchor_1612" href="#Footnote_1612" class="fnanchor">[1612]</a></p>

<p><b>Penalties for affixing False Notice.</b>&mdash;Every person who
shall insert or impress a copyright notice, "or words of the
same import, in or upon any book, map, chart, dramatic or
musical composition, print, cut, engraving or photograph or
other article, whether such article be subject to copyright or
otherwise, for which he has not obtained a copyright, or shall
knowingly issue or sell any article bearing a notice of United
States copyright which has not been copyrighted in this
country; or shall import any book, photograph, chromo or
lithograph, or other article bearing such notice of copyright, or
words of the same purport which is not copyrighted in this
country, shall be liable to a penalty of $100, recoverable one-half
for the person who shall sue for such penalty, and one-half
to the use of the United States."<a id="FNanchor_1613" href="#Footnote_1613" class="fnanchor">[1613]</a></p>

<p>This section was amended in 1891 and again in 1897. It
now reads as above. Before 1897 the penalty was not recoverable
from one who sold copies, knowing them to contain a
false notice, unless he had made the book or caused the notice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
to be inserted.<a id="FNanchor_1614" href="#Footnote_1614" class="fnanchor">[1614]</a> Before 1897 also there could be no conviction
unless the article on which the false notice was impressed was
a copyrightable article.<a id="FNanchor_1615" href="#Footnote_1615" class="fnanchor">[1615]</a></p>

<p>The penalty is not recoverable for each copy, but for each
issue. Where chromos were struck off in large numbers for
advertising purposes, each separate batch being printed with a
different trade name for different customers, it was held that
the penalty was recoverable on each batch.<a id="FNanchor_1616" href="#Footnote_1616" class="fnanchor">[1616]</a> For a notice to
incur the penalty as a false notice, it is not necessary that it
should have been printed as directed by the Acts. It will be subject
to the penalty even although printed in another part of the
book.<a id="FNanchor_1617" href="#Footnote_1617" class="fnanchor">[1617]</a> Rough prints of a picture made for the purpose of
advertisement bore a false notice, and were held to have
incurred the penalty.<a id="FNanchor_1618" href="#Footnote_1618" class="fnanchor">[1618]</a> It is not unlawful to impress a notice
of copyright on a rough copy of a copyright picture, even
although such copy is not separately copyrighted.<a id="FNanchor_1619" href="#Footnote_1619" class="fnanchor">[1619]</a> Liability
will not attach unless the notice contains the essentials of a
sufficient copyright notice, viz. "name," "claim of exclusive
right," and "date when obtained." Thus where the date was
omitted no penalties were recovered.<a id="FNanchor_1620" href="#Footnote_1620" class="fnanchor">[1620]</a> Any one who causes a
false notice to be impressed is equally liable with the person
who himself impresses it.<a id="FNanchor_1621" href="#Footnote_1621" class="fnanchor">[1621]</a></p>

<p><b>Importing Books Printed Outside the United States.</b>&mdash;If
copyright has been secured in the United States, importation
of any book, chromo, lithograph, or photograph, or any plates
of the same, not made from type set, negatives, or drawings on
stone made within the limits of the United States,<a id="FNanchor_1622" href="#Footnote_1622" class="fnanchor">[1622]</a> is prohibited,
either with or without the consent of the owner of the copyright.</p>

<p>Except&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. Works printed or manufactured more than twenty years

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

COMMON LAW RIGHTS</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section I.&mdash;Published Work.</span></h3>

<p>After a work has been published it has no protection in the
nature of copyright except under an Act of Congress.<a id="FNanchor_1630" href="#Footnote_1630" class="fnanchor">[1630]</a> If
either from the nature of the work, or from the want of conforming
with the formalities of the Act, there is no statutory
protection, then there can be no exclusive right of copying
the work. After a drama or musical piece has been published
as a book, not only the copyright in it but also the performing
right depends entirely on statutory protection.<a id="FNanchor_1631" href="#Footnote_1631" class="fnanchor">[1631]</a> Performance
on the stage not being a publication, affects neither the right
of copy nor the performing right.</p>

<p>Although there is no right of copy in a published work
except under statute, there are certain common-law rights
based on fraud or implied contract which are incident thereto,
and which neither depend on nor are affected by statutory
protection.</p>

<p><b>Passing off.</b>&mdash;One man is not entitled so to produce his book
as to lead the public to believe it is the work of another.<a id="FNanchor_1632" href="#Footnote_1632" class="fnanchor">[1632]</a> The
same or a similar title is the most usual method of passing off.
One cannot monopolise a purely descriptive title such as "Latin
Grammar" or "Guide to the Alps;" but it was held a passing
off to take the title, "The <i>Fram</i> Expedition&mdash;Nansen in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
the Frozen World;"<a id="FNanchor_1633" href="#Footnote_1633" class="fnanchor">[1633]</a> so the title "Social Register" to a
select list of residents in a certain district was infringed by a
similar list bearing the title "Howard's Social Register."<a id="FNanchor_1634" href="#Footnote_1634" class="fnanchor">[1634]</a> It
is immaterial in a question of passing off that the book itself is
unprotected from copying. Thus an English magazine called
"Chatterbox" was largely sold in the United States, but was
not copyright. Although it would have been quite legal to have
copied the English magazine and sold such copies under its own
title, it was not permissible to publish another magazine under
the title of "Chatterbox."<a id="FNanchor_1635" href="#Footnote_1635" class="fnanchor">[1635]</a> In another case it was held that
one might not adopt the title of another's operetta for his own,
even although the songs and vocal scores of the operetta had
been published under the title without securing copyright.<a id="FNanchor_1636" href="#Footnote_1636" class="fnanchor">[1636]</a></p>

<p>It is not a passing off to reprint another man's book and
sell it in his own name, and if the copyright has expired he has
no redress.<a id="FNanchor_1637" href="#Footnote_1637" class="fnanchor">[1637]</a> He has no property in his own name as such.
After the copyright had expired in "Webster's Dictionary,"
Webster's assignee was held to have no ground for restraining
any one from reprinting and selling "Webster's Dictionary"
under that title.<a id="FNanchor_1638" href="#Footnote_1638" class="fnanchor">[1638]</a> Even where the name was a pseudonym,
"Mark Twain," the author was not entitled to prevent others
from printing and selling some non-copyright work of his as
"Sketches by Mark Twain."<a id="FNanchor_1639" href="#Footnote_1639" class="fnanchor">[1639]</a></p>

<p>A man may prevent the publication under his name of a
book of which he is not the author or which has been mutilated
without his authority.<a id="FNanchor_1640" href="#Footnote_1640" class="fnanchor">[1640]</a> Henry Drummond, the evangelist,
delivered a series of lectures at Boston, Massachusetts, on
"The Evolution of Man." Eight out of twelve lectures were
partially printed with the author's consent in the British Weekly,
and no copyright was secured in America. It was held that
Professor Drummond was entitled to restrain a reprint of these
published lectures reproduced with material alterations, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
represented as being the complete series of lectures.<a id="FNanchor_1641" href="#Footnote_1641" class="fnanchor">[1641]</a> An
author who has parted with or lost his copyright has no right
to regulate the manner in which his work may be published,
provided that there is no misrepresentation causing injury to
the author's name.<a id="FNanchor_1642" href="#Footnote_1642" class="fnanchor">[1642]</a></p>

<p>In one case,<a id="FNanchor_1643" href="#Footnote_1643" class="fnanchor">[1643]</a> however, the defendants were restrained from
a similar proceeding on the ground of unfair trading. They
bought second-hand school books published by the plaintiff,
and rebound them so as to have the exact appearance of the
plaintiff's books when new. It was held that they were entitled
to do this without infringing any right of the plaintiff
in their copyright book; but it was also held that it was not
fair trading to sell the rebound books without sufficient notice
that they were rebound.</p>

<p>If there have been several editions of a book, the copyright
in the first of which only has expired, the author may restrain
a publisher from reprinting and publishing the first edition so
as to lead the public to believe that it is a later edition still
copyright.<a id="FNanchor_1644" href="#Footnote_1644" class="fnanchor">[1644]</a> The owner of a series of novels, published in two
editions, cannot prevent a third person buying a large quantity
of the sixth edition and binding them so as to somewhat resemble
the dearer edition.<a id="FNanchor_1645" href="#Footnote_1645" class="fnanchor">[1645]</a> When the "Encyclopædia Britannica"
was published, only a few of the articles were copyright
in America. It was held that it was permissible for an American
publisher to reprint the whole work so far as not copyright,
and to substitute new articles for the copyright articles, and so
long as there was no attempt to defraud the public to publish
it as the "Encyclopædia Britannica" so revised.<a id="FNanchor_1646" href="#Footnote_1646" class="fnanchor">[1646]</a></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Section II.&mdash;Unpublished Work.</span></h3>

<p>Unpublished work is protected from interference by the
common law of England, which was brought to and adopted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
by the United States.<a id="FNanchor_1647" href="#Footnote_1647" class="fnanchor">[1647]</a> When the common law is asserted one
must look to the law of the State in which the controversy
originated,<a id="FNanchor_1648" href="#Footnote_1648" class="fnanchor">[1648]</a> since although the common law of England was
adopted, it was adopted only so far as its principles were suited
to the conditions of the colonies at the time, and some States
have incorporated with their laws more and some less. The
rights at common law in unpublished work were not abrogated
by Acts of Congress establishing copyright in published
work.</p>

<p>The author of an unfinished work has the right at common
law to prevent any one from making any unauthorised use of
his work.<a id="FNanchor_1649" href="#Footnote_1649" class="fnanchor">[1649]</a> The author may without publishing make a communication
of the contents of his work to a limited number,<a id="FNanchor_1650" href="#Footnote_1650" class="fnanchor">[1650]</a>
and he may prescribe to them what conditions he pleases.<a id="FNanchor_1651" href="#Footnote_1651" class="fnanchor">[1651]</a> A
play or song is not published by performance nor a lecture by
delivery.<a id="FNanchor_1652" href="#Footnote_1652" class="fnanchor">[1652]</a> A work of art is probably published by public
exhibition,<a id="FNanchor_1653" href="#Footnote_1653" class="fnanchor">[1653]</a> but not by a private view. A spectator of an unpublished
play is not entitled to reproduce substantial parts of
it even from memory.<a id="FNanchor_1654" href="#Footnote_1654" class="fnanchor">[1654]</a> Similarly with a musical work or
lecture.</p>

<p>An alien author has an equal right with a citizen of the
United States to sue at common law for interference with his
manuscript.<a id="FNanchor_1655" href="#Footnote_1655" class="fnanchor">[1655]</a> A statutory remedy is given for the unauthorised
printing or publishing of any manuscript. The offender is
liable "for all damages occasioned by such injury."<a id="FNanchor_1656" href="#Footnote_1656" class="fnanchor">[1656]</a> This
statutory remedy neither destroys nor limits the common law
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
right.<a id="FNanchor_1657" href="#Footnote_1657" class="fnanchor">[1657]</a> No new right is secured.<a id="FNanchor_1658" href="#Footnote_1658" class="fnanchor">[1658]</a> The practical result is that
an alternative remedy in the Federal tribunals is provided
where the parties are subjects of the same State. The plaintiff
may proceed either in the State Court or the Federal
Court.<a id="FNanchor_1659" href="#Footnote_1659" class="fnanchor">[1659]</a> Manuscript under this section is limited to the
meaning of a written document. It does not include a
picture.<a id="FNanchor_1660" href="#Footnote_1660" class="fnanchor">[1660]</a>

<h3>THE ENGRAVING COPYRIGHT ACT, 1734.<br />

<small>8 <span class="smcap">Geo. II. c. 13.</span></small></h3>

<p class="hang">An Act for the Encouragement of the Arts of Designing, Engraving, and
Etching historical and other Prints, by vesting the Properties thereof
in the Inventors and Engravers, during the Time therein mentioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preamble.</div>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Whereas</span> divers Persons have by their own Genius, Industry, Pains,
and Expense, invented and engraved, or worked in Mezzotinto or Chiaro
Oscuro, Sets of historical and other Prints, in hopes to have reaped the
sole Benefit of their Labours:</p>

<p>And whereas Printsellers, and other Persons, have of late, without the
Consent of the Inventors, Designers, and Proprietors of such Prints,
frequently taken the Liberty of copying, engraving, and publishing, or
causing to be copied, engraved, and published, base Copies of such
Works, Designs, and Prints, to the very great Prejudice and Detriment
of the Inventors, Designers, and Proprietors thereof:</p>

<div class="sidenote">After 24th
June, 1735,
the property

<p>For Remedy thereof, and for preventing such Practices for the future,
be it enacted, That from and after the Twenty-fourth Day of June, which
shall be in the Year of our Lord One thousand seven hundred and thirty-five,
every Person who shall invent and design, engrave, etch, or work in
Mezzotinto or Chiaro Oscuro, or, from his own Works and Invention,
shall cause to be designed and engraved, etched, or worked in Mezzotinto
or Chiaro Oscuro, any historical or other Print or Prints,<a id="FNanchor_1661" href="#Footnote_1661" class="fnanchor">[1661]</a> shall
have the sole Right and Liberty of printing and reprinting the same for
the Term of Fourteen Years, to commence from the Day of the first
Publishing thereof, which shall be truly engraved with the Name of the
Proprietor on each Plate, and printed on every such Print or Prints;
and that if any Printseller, or other Person whatsoever, from and after
the said Twenty-fourth Day of June, One thousand seven hundred and
thirty-five, within the Time limited by this Act, shall engrave, etch, or
work, as aforesaid, or in any other Manner copy and sell, or cause to be
engraved, etched, or copied and sold, in the Whole or in Part, by varying,
adding to, or diminishing from the main Design, or shall print, reprint, or
import for Sale, or cause to be printed, reprinted, or imported for Sale,
any such Print or Prints, or any Parts thereof, without the Consent of the
Proprietor or Proprietors thereof first had and obtained in Writing, signed
by him or them respectively, in the Presence of Two or more credible
Witnesses, or knowing the same to be so printed or reprinted without the
Consent of the Proprietor or Proprietors, shall publish, sell, or expose to
Sale, or otherwise, or in any other Manner dispose of, or cause to be
published, sold, or exposed to Sale, or otherwise, or in any other Manner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
disposed of, any such Print or Prints without such Consent first had and
obtained as aforesaid, then such Offender or Offenders shall forfeit the
Plate or Plates on which such Print or Prints are or shall be copied, and
all and every Sheet or Sheets (being part of or whereon such Print or
Prints are or shall be so copied or printed) to the Proprietor or Proprietors
of such original Print or Prints, who shall forthwith destroy and
damask the same; and further, that every such Offender or Offenders
shall forfeit Five Shillings for every Print which shall be found in his,
her, or their Custody, either printed or published, and exposed to Sale,
or otherwise disposed of contrary to the true Intent and Meaning of this
Act, the One Moiety thereof to the King's most Excellent Majesty, His
Heirs and Successors, and the other Moiety thereof to any Person or
Persons that shall sue for the same, to be recovered in any of His
Majesty's Courts of Record at Westminster, by Action of Debt, Bill,

Copyright
Act.</div>

<p>I. <i>Whereas by an Act passed in the Session of Parliament held in the First
and Second Years of the Reign of Her present Majesty, intituled An Act for
securing to Authors in certain Cases the Benefit of international Copyright
(and which Act is hereinafter, for the sake of Perspicuity, designated as
"the International Copyright Act"), Her Majesty was empowered by Order
in Council to direct that the Authors of Books which should after a future
Time, to be specified in such Order in Council, be published in any Foreign
Country, to be specified in such Order in Council, and their Executors,
Administrators, and Assigns, should have the sole Liberty of printing and
reprinting such Books within the British Dominions for such Term as Her
Majesty should by such Order in Council direct, not exceeding the Term which
Authors, being British Subjects, were then, (that is to say) at the Time of
passing the said Act, entitled to in respect of Books first published in the
United Kingdom; and the said Act contains divers Enactments securing to
Authors and their Representatives the Copyright in the Books to which any
such Order in Council should extend: And whereas an Act was passed in
the Session of Parliament held in the Fifth and Sixth Years of the Reign of
Her present Majesty, intituled An Act to amend the Law of Copyright (and
which Act is hereinafter, for the sake of Perspicuity, designated as "the
Copyright Amendment Act"), repealing various Acts therein mentioned
relating to the Copyright of printed Books, and extending, defining, and
securing to Authors and their Representatives the Copyright of Books: And
whereas an Act was passed in the Session of Parliament held in the Third
and Fourth Years of the Reign of His late Majesty King William the
Fourth, intituled An Act to amend the Laws relating to Dramatic Literary
Property (and which Act is hereinafter, for the sake of Perspicuity,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
designated as "the Dramatic Literary Property Act"), whereby the sole
Liberty of representing or causing to be represented any Dramatic Piece in
any Place of Dramatic Entertainment in any Part of the British
Dominions, which should be composed and not printed or published by
the Author thereof or his Assignee, was secured to such Author or his
Assignee; and by the said Act it was enacted, that the Author of any such
Production which should thereafter be printed and published, or his Assignee,
should have the like sole Liberty of Representation until the End of Twenty-eight
Years from the first Publication thereof: And whereas by the said
Copyright Amendment Act the Provisions of the said Dramatic Literary
Property Act and of the said Copyright Amendment Act were made applicable
to Musical Compositions; and it was thereby also enacted, that the sole
Liberty of representing or performing, or causing or permitting to be
represented or performed, in any Part of the British Dominions, any
Dramatic Piece or Musical Composition, should endure and be the Property
of the Author thereof and his Assigns for the Term in the said Copyright
Amendment Act provided for the Duration of the Copyright in Books, and
that the Provisions therein enacted in respect of the Property of such Copyright
should apply to the Liberty of representing or performing any Dramatic
Piece or Musical Composition: And whereas under or by virtue of the Four
several Acts next hereinafter mentioned; (that is to say,) an Act passed in
the Eighth Year of the Reign of His late Majesty King George the Second,
intituled An Act for the Encouragement of the Arts of designing, engraving,
and etching historical and other Prints, by vesting the Properties thereof in
the Inventors or Engravers during the Time therein mentioned; an Act
passed in the Seventh Year of His late Majesty King George the Third,
intituled An Act to amend and render more effectual an Act made in the
Eighth Year of the Reign of King George the Second, for Encouragement of
the Arts of designing, engraving, and etching historical and other Prints;
and for vesting in and securing to Jane Hogarth, Widow, the Property in
certain Prints; an Act passed in the Seventeenth Year of the Reign of His
late Majesty King George the Third, intituled An Act for more effectually
securing the Property of Prints to Inventors and Engravers, by enabling
them to sue for and recover Penalties in certain Cases; and an Act passed in
the Session of Parliament held in the Sixth and Seventh Years of the Reign
of His late Majesty King William the Fourth, intituled An Act to extend
the Protection of Copyright in Prints and Engravings to Ireland; (and
which said Four several Acts are hereinafter, for the sake of Perspicuity,
designated as the Engraving Copyright Acts;) every Person who invents or
designs, engraves, etches, or works in Mezzotinto or Chiaro-oscuro, or from
his own Work, Design, or Invention causes or procures to be designed,
engraved, etched, or worked in Mezzotinto or Chiaro-oscuro any historical
Print or Prints, or any Print or Prints of any Portrait, Conversation,
Landscape, or Architecture, Map, Chart, or Plan, or any other Print or
Prints whatsoever, and every Person who engraves, etches, or works
in Mezzotinto or Chiaro-oscuro, or causes to be engraved, etched, or worked,
any Print taken from any Picture, Drawing, Model, or Sculpture, either
ancient or modern, notwithstanding such Print shall not have been graven or
drawn from the original Design of such Graver, Etcher, or Draftsman,
is entitled to the Copyright of such Print for the Term of Twenty-eight
Years from the first publishing thereof; and by the said several Engraving
Copyright Acts it is provided that the Name of the Proprietor shall be truly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
engraved on each Plate, and printed on every such Print, and Remedies are
provided for the Infringement of such Copyright: And whereas under and
by virtue of an Act passed in the Thirty-eighth Year of the Reign of His late
Majesty King George the Third, intituled An Act for encouraging the Art
of making new Models and Casts of Busts and other Things therein
mentioned, and of an Act passed in the Fifty-fourth Year of the Reign of
His late Majesty King George the Third, intituled An Act to amend and
render more effectual an Act of His present Majesty, for encouraging the Art
of making new Models and Casts of Busts and other Things therein
mentioned, and for giving further Encouragement to such Arts, (and which
said Acts are, for the sake of Perspicuity, hereinafter designated as the
Sculpture Copyright Acts,) every Person who makes or causes to be made any
new and original Sculpture, or Model or Copy or Cast of the Human Figure,
any Bust or Part of the Human Figure clothed in Drapery or otherwise,
any Animal or Part of any Animal combined with the Human Figure or
otherwise, any Subject, being Matter of Invention in Sculpture, any Alto or
Basso-Relievo, representing any of the Matters aforesaid, or any Cast from
Nature of the Human Figure or Part thereof, or of any Animal or Part
thereof, or of any such Subject representing any of the Matters aforesaid,
whether separate or combined, is entitled to the Copyright in such new and
original Sculpture, Model, Copy, and Cast, for Fourteen Years from first
putting forth and publishing the same, and for an additional Period of
Fourteen Years in case the original Maker is living at the End of the first
Period; and by the said Acts it is provided that the Name of the Proprietor,
with the Date of the Publication thereof, is to be put on all such Sculptures,
Models, Copies, and Casts, and Remedies are provided for the Infringement
of such Copyright: And whereas the Powers vested in Her Majesty by the
said International Copyright Act are insufficient to enable Her Majesty to
confer upon Authors of Books first published in Foreign Countries Copyright
of the like Duration, and with the like Remedies for the Infringement
thereof, which are conferred and provided by the said Copyright Amendment
Act with respect to Authors of Books first published in the British
Dominions; and the said International Copyright Act does not empower
Her Majesty to confer any exclusive Right of representing or performing
Dramatic Pieces or Musical Compositions first published in Foreign
Countries upon the Authors thereof, nor to extend the Privilege of Copyright
to Prints and Sculpture first published abroad; and it is expedient to vest
increased Powers in Her Majesty in this respect, and for that Purpose
to repeal the said International Copyright Act, and to give such other Powers
to Her Majesty, and to make such further Provisions, as are hereinafter
contained:<a id="FNanchor_1737" href="#Footnote_1737" class="fnanchor">[1737]</a> the said recited Act herein designated as the International Copyright
Act shall be and the same is hereby repealed</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1738" href="#Footnote_1738" class="fnanchor">[1738]</a></p>

on Books, Prints, and Musical Works published in France: And whereas
certain of the Stipulations on the Part of Her Majesty contained in the
said Treaty require the Authority of Parliament: And whereas it is
expedient that such Authority should be given, and that Her Majesty
should be enabled to make similar Stipulations in any Treaty on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
Subject of Copyright which may hereafter be concluded with any Foreign
Power: Be it enacted as follows:</p>

of such Books, except only such Parts of the said Enactments as relate to the
Delivery of Copies of Books for the Use of the British Museum and for the
Use of the other Libraries therein referred to.</i></p>

<p>IV. <i>Her Majesty may by Order in Council direct that Authors of

Piece or Musical Composition published in any Foreign Country.</p>

<p>VII. Notwithstanding any thing in the said International Copyright
Act or in this Act contained any Article of Political Discussion which has
been published in any Newspaper or Periodical in a Foreign Country
may, if the source from which the same is taken be acknowledged, be
republished or translated in any Newspaper or Periodical in this Country:
and any Article relating to any other Subject which has been so published
as aforesaid may, if the source from which the same is taken be acknowledged,
be republished or translated in like Manner, unless the Author
has signified his Intention of preserving the Copyright therein and the
Right of Translating the same in some conspicuous Part of the Newspaper
or Periodical in which the same was first published, in which case the
same shall without the Formalities required by the next following Section,
receive the same Protection as is by virtue of the International Copyright
Act or this Act extended to Books.</p>

<p>VIII. <i>No Author, or his Executors, Administrators, or Assigns shall be

Work must be registered and deposited in this Country in the Manner required

either of them, and which are printed, reprinted, or made in any Foreign
Country, except that in which such Work shall be first published, and all
unauthorised Translations of any Book or Dramatic Piece, the Publication

whereof not authorised as in this Act mentioned shall for the Time being
be prevented under any Order in Council made in pursuance of this Act,

British Dominions, except by, or with the Consent of the registered Proprietor
of the Copyright 6f such Work or of such Book or Piece, or his
Agent authorised in Writing; and the Provision of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 45, for
the Forfeiture, Seizure, and Destruction of any printed Book first published

Copyright, or a Person authorised by such Proprietor, shall extend and be
applicable to all Copies of any Works of Literature and Art, and to all
Translations, the Importation whereof into any Part of the British
Dominions is prohibited under this Act.</p>

<p>X. The Provisions hereinbefore contained shall be incorporated with
the International Copyright Act, and shall be read and construed therewith
as One Act.</p>

Canada respecting Copyright.</p>

<p class="author">[2nd August 1875.]</p>

<p><i>Whereas by an Order of Her Majesty in Council, dated the 7th day of
July 1868,  it was ordered that all prohibitions contained in Acts of the
Imperial Parliament against the importing into the Province of Canada, or
against the selling, letting out to hire, exposing for sale or hire, or possessing
therein foreign reprints of books first composed, written, printed, or published
in the United Kingdom, and entitled to copyright therein, should be suspended
so far as regarded Canada:</i></p>

<p><i>And whereas the Senate and House of Commons of Canada did, in the
second session of the third Parliament of the Dominion of Canada, held in
the thirty-eighth year of Her Majesty's reign, pass a Bill intituled "An Act
respecting Copyrights," which Bill has been reserved by the Governor-General
for the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure thereon:</i></p>

<p><i>And whereas by the said reserved Bill provision is made, subject to such
conditions as in the said Bill are mentioned, for securing in Canada the
rights of authors in respect of matters of copyright, and for prohibiting the
importation into Canada of any work for which copyright under the said
reserved Bill has been secured; and whereas doubts have arisen whether the
said reserved Bill may not be repugnant to the said Order in Council, and
it is expedient to remove such doubts and to confirm the said Bill:</i><a id="FNanchor_1766" href="#Footnote_1766" class="fnanchor">[1766]</a></p>

Bill shall come into operation at such time and in such manner as Her

any such summons the person so summoned shall not appear before
such judge, then upon proof by affidavit that such summons or a true
copy thereof has been personally served upon the person so summoned,
or sent to him by post to or left at his last known place of abode or

to be imported into the British possessions abroad: Provided
always that no such books shall be prohibited to be imported as aforesaid,

the several ports in the British possessions abroad, from time to time to
be publicly exposed there, lists of books respecting which such notice
shall have been duly given, and all books imported contrary thereto shall

and a country to which an order under the said Acts applies.</p>

<p>(2.) Where a work produced simultaneously in the United Kingdom,
and in some foreign country or countries is by virtue of an Order in
Council under the International Copyright Acts deemed for the purpose
of copyright to be first produced in one of the said foreign countries, and

International Copyright Acts applies, the author or publisher, as the case
may be, shall, unless otherwise directed by the order, have the same right
of preventing the production in and importation into the United Kingdom
of any translation not authorised by him of the said work as he has of
preventing the production and importation of the original work.</p>

<p>(2.) Provided that if after the expiration of ten years, or any other
term prescribed by the order, next after the end of the year in which the
work, or in the case of a book published in numbers each number of the

translation of such work shall cease.</p>

<p>(3.) The law relating to copyright, including this Act, shall apply to a
lawfully produced translation of a work in like manner as if it were an

<h3>THE COPYRIGHT (MUSICAL COMPOSITIONS) ACT, 1888.<br />

51 &amp; 52 <span class="smcap">Vict. c.</span> 17.</h3>

<p class="hang">An Act to amend the Law relating to the Recovery of Penalties for the
unauthorised Performance of Copyright Musical Compositions.</p>
<p class="author">[5th July 1888.]</p>

<p>Whereas it is expedient to further amend the law relating to copyright
in musical compositions, and to further protect the public from
vexatious proceedings for the recovery of penalties for the unauthorised
performance of the same:</p>

<p>Be it therefore enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by
and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Provision

<p>I. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Act of the session held in
the third and fourth years of His Majesty King William the Fourth,
chapter fifteen, to amend the laws relating to dramatic literary property,
or any other Act in which those provisions are incorporated, the penalty
or damages to be awarded upon any action or proceedings in respect of
each and every unauthorised representation or performance of any musical
composition, whether published before or after the passing of this Act,
shall be such a sum or sums as shall, in the discretion of the Court or
judge before whom such action or proceedings shall be tried, be reasonable,
and the Court or judge before whom such action or proceedings shall be
tried may award a less sum than forty shillings in respect of each and
every such unauthorised representation or performance as aforesaid, or a
nominal penalty or nominal damages as the justice of the case may
require.

<p>II. The costs of all such actions or proceedings as aforesaid shall be

<p>III. The proprietor, tenant, or occupier of any place of dramatic
entertainment, or other place at which any unauthorised representation
or performance of any musical composition, whether published before or
after the passing of this Act, shall take place, shall not by reason of such
representation or performance be liable to any penalty or damages in
respect thereof, unless he shall wilfully cause or permit such unauthorised
representation or performance, knowing it to be unauthorised.<a id="FNanchor_1776" href="#Footnote_1776" class="fnanchor">[1776]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Saving for

<p>IV. The provisions of this Act shall not apply to any action or proceedings

<h3>THE REVENUE ACT, 1889.<br />

52 &amp; 53 <span class="smcap">Vict. c.</span> 42.</h3>

<p>I. The following goods shall from and after the passing of this Act
be included amongst the goods enumerated and described on the table
of prohibitions and restrictions contained in Section 42 of the Customs
Consolidation Act, 1876, namely:</p>

<p>Books, first published in any country or state other than the United
Kingdom, wherein under the International Copyright Act, 1886, or any
other Act or any Order in Council made under the authority of any Act,
there is a subsisting Copyright in the United Kingdom, printed or reprinted
in any country or state other than the country or state in which
they were first published,<a id="FNanchor_1777" href="#Footnote_1777" class="fnanchor">[1777]</a> and as to which the owner of the copyright or
his agent in the United Kingdom has given to the Commissioners of
Customs in the manner prescribed by Section 44 of the Customs Consolidation
Act, 1876, a notice in such form and giving such particulars
as those Commissioners require, and accompanied by a declaration as
provided in that Section.</p>

<h3>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS</h3>

<h3>THE BERNE CONVENTION, 1886.</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article I.</span></h4>

<p>The Contracting States are constituted into an Union for the protection
of the rights of authors over their literary and artistic works.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article II.</span></h4>

<p><i>Authors of any of the countries of the Union, or their lawful representatives,
shall enjoy in the other countries for their works, whether published in
one of those countries or unpublished, the rights which the respective laws do
now or may hereafter grant to natives.</i><a id="FNanchor_1778" href="#Footnote_1778" class="fnanchor">[1778]</a></p>

<p>The enjoyment of these rights is subject to the accomplishment of the
conditions and formalities described by law in the country of origin of the
work, and cannot exceed in the other countries the term of protection
granted in the said country of origin.</p>

<p>The country of origin of the work is that in which the work is first
published, or if such publication takes place simultaneously in several
countries of the Union, that one of them in which the shortest term of
protection is granted by law.</p>

<p>For unpublished works the country to which the author belongs is
considered the country of origin of the work.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article III.</span></h4>

<p><i>The stipulations of the present Convention apply equally to the publishers
of literary and artistic works published in one of the countries of the Union,
but of which the authors belong to a country which is not a party to the
Union.</i></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article IV.</span></h4>

<p>The expression "literary and artistic works" comprehends books,
pamphlets, and all other writings; dramatic or dramatico-musical works,
musical compositions with or without words; works of design, painting,
sculpture, and engraving; lithographs, illustrations, geographical charts;
plans, sketches, and plastic works relative to geography, topography,
architecture, or science in general; in fact, every production whatsoever
in the literary, scientific, or artistic domain which can be published by any
mode of impression or reproduction.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article V.</span></h4>

<p><i>Authors of any of the countries of the Union, or their lawful representatives,
shall enjoy in the other countries the exclusive right of making or
authorising the translation of their works until the expiration of ten years
from the publication of the original work in one of the countries of the Union.</i></p>

<p>For works published in incomplete parts ("livraisons") the period of
ten years commences from the date of publication of the last part of the
original work.</p>

<p>For works composed of several volumes published at intervals, as well
as for bulletins or collections ("cahiers") published by literary or scientific
Societies, or by private persons, each volume, bulletin, or collection is,
with regard to the period of ten years, considered as a separate work.</p>

<p>In the cases provided for by the present Article, and for the calculation
of the period of protection, the 31st December of the year in which the
work was published is admitted as the date of publication.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article VI.</span></h4>

<p>Authorised translations are protected as original works. They consequently
enjoy the protection stipulated in Articles II. and III. as regards
their unauthorised reproduction in the countries of the Union.</p>

<p>It is understood that, in the case of a work for which the translating
right has fallen into the public domain, the translator cannot oppose the
translation of the same work by other writers.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article VII.</span></h4>

<p><i>Articles from newspapers or periodicals published in any of the countries
of the Union may be reproduced in original or in translation in the other
countries of the Union, unless the authors or publishers have expressly
forbidden it. For periodicals it is sufficient if the prohibition is made in a
general manner at the beginning of each number of the periodical.</i></p>

<p><i>This prohibition cannot in any case apply to articles of political discussion,
or to the reproduction of news of the day or current topics.</i></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article VIII.</span></h4>

<p>As regards the liberty of extracting portions from literary or artistic
works for use in publications destined for educational or scientific purposes,
or for chrestomathies, the matter is to be decided by the legislation of the
different countries of the Union, or by special arrangements existing or to
be concluded between them.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article IX.</span><a id="FNanchor_1779" href="#Footnote_1779" class="fnanchor">[1779]</a></h4>

<p>The stipulations of Article II. apply to the public representation of
dramatic or dramatico-musical works, whether such works be published or
not.</p>

<p>Authors of dramatic or dramatico-musical works, or their lawful
representatives, are, during the existence of their exclusive right of
translation, equally protected against the unauthorised public representation
of translations of their works.</p>

<p>The stipulations of Article II. apply equally to the public performance
of unpublished musical works, or of published works in which the author
has expressly declared on the title-page or commencement of the work
that he forbids the public performance.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article X.</span></h4>

<p>Unauthorised indirect appropriations of a literary or artistic work, of
various kinds, such as adaptations, arrangements of music, &amp;c., are specially
included amongst the illicit reproductions to which the present Convention
applies, when they are only the reproduction of a particular work, in the
same form, or in another form, with non-essential alterations, additions, or
abridgments, so made as not to confer the character of a new original
work.</p>

<p>It is agreed that, in the application of the present Article, the Tribunals
of the various countries of the Union will, if there is occasion, conform
themselves to the provisions of their respective laws.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XI.</span></h4>

<p>In order that the authors of works protected by the present Convention
shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be considered as such, and
be consequently admitted to institute proceedings against pirates before
the Courts of the various countries of the Union, it will be sufficient that
their name be indicated on the work in the accustomed manner.</p>

<p>For anonymous or pseudonymous works, the publisher whose name is
indicated on the work is entitled to protect the rights belonging to the
author. He is, without other proof, reputed the lawful representative of
the anonymous or pseudonymous author.</p>

<p>It is, nevertheless, agreed that the Tribunals may, if necessary, require
the production of a certificate from the competent authority to the effect
that the formalities prescribed by law in the country of origin have been
accomplished, as contemplated in Article II.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XII.</span></h4>

<p><i>Pirated works may be seized on importation into those countries of the
Union where the original work enjoys legal protection.</i></p>

<p><i>The seizure shall take place conformably to the domestic law of each State.</i></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XIII.</span></h4>

<p>It is understood that the provisions of the present Convention cannot
in any way derogate from the right belonging to the Government of each
country of the Union to permit, to control, or to prohibit, by measures of
domestic legislation or police, the circulation, representation, or exhibition
of any works or productions in regard to which the competent authority
may find it necessary to exercise that right.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XIV.</span></h4>

<p>Under the reserves and conditions to be determined by common
agreement,<a id="FNanchor_1780" href="#Footnote_1780" class="fnanchor">[1780]</a> the present Convention applies to all works which at the
moment of its coming into force have not yet fallen into the public
domain in the country of origin.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XV.</span></h4>

<p>It is understood that the Governments of the countries of the Union
reserve to themselves respectively the right to enter into separate and
particular arrangements between each other, provided always that such
arrangements confer upon authors or their lawful representatives more
extended rights than those granted by the Union, or embody other
stipulations not contrary to the present Convention.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XVI.</span><a id="FNanchor_1781" href="#Footnote_1781" class="fnanchor">[1781]</a></h4>

<p>An international office is established, under the name of "Office of the
International Union for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works."</p>

<p>This Office, of which the expenses will be borne by the Administrations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
of all the countries of the Union, is placed under the high authority of
the Superior Administration of the Swiss Confederation, and works under
its direction. The functions of this Office are determined by common
accord between the countries of the Union.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XVII.</span></h4>

<p>The present Convention may be submitted to revisions in order to
introduce therein amendments calculated to perfect the system of the
Union.</p>

<p>Questions of this kind, as well as those which are of interest to the
Union in other respects, will be considered in Conferences to be held
successively in the countries of the Union by Delegates of the said
countries.</p>

<p>It is understood that no alteration in the present Convention shall be
binding on the Union except by the unanimous consent of the countries
composing it.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XVIII.</span></h4>

<p>Countries which have not become parties to the present Convention,
and which grant by their domestic law the protection of rights secured by
this Convention, shall be admitted to accede thereto on request to that
effect.</p>

<p>Such accession shall be notified in writing to the Government of the
Swiss Confederation, who will communicate it to all the other countries of
the Union.</p>

<p>Such accession shall imply full adhesion to all the clauses and admission
to all the advantages provided by the present Convention.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XIX.</span></h4>

<p>Countries acceding to the present Convention shall also have the
right to accede thereto at any time for their Colonies or foreign possessions.</p>

<p>They may do this either by a general declaration comprehending all
their Colonies or possessions within the accession, or by specially naming
those comprised therein, or by simply indicating those which are excluded.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XX.</span></h4>

<p>The present Convention shall be put in force three months after the
exchange of the ratifications, and shall remain in effect for an indefinite
period until the termination of a year from the day on which it may have
been denounced.</p>

<p><i>Such denunciation shall be made to the Government authorised to receive
accessions, and shall only be effective as regards the country making it, the
Convention remaining in full force and effect for the other countries of the
Union.</i></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article XXI.</span></h4>

<p>The present Convention shall be ratified, and the ratifications exchanged
at Berne, within the space of one year at the latest.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span></p>

<p>In witness whereof, the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed the
same, and have affixed thereto the seal of their arms.</p>

<p>Done at Berne, the 9th day of September 1886.</p>

<h4><i>Additional Article.</i></h4>

<p>The Plenipotentiaries assembled to sign the Convention concerning
the creation of an International Union for the protection of literary and
artistic works have agreed upon the following Additional Article, which
shall be ratified together with the Convention to which it relates:</p>

<p>The Convention concluded this day in nowise affects the maintenance
of existing Conventions between the Contracting States, provided always
that such Conventions confer on authors, or their lawful representatives,
rights more extended than those secured by the Union, or contain other
stipulations which are not contrary to the said Convention.</p>

<p>In witness whereof, the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed the
present Additional Article.</p>

<p>Done at Berne, the 9th day of September 1886.</p>

<h4><i>Final Protocol.</i></h4>

<p>In proceeding to the signature of the Convention concluded this day,
the undersigned Plenipotentiaries have declared and stipulated as
follows:</p>

<p>1. <i>As regards Article IV. it is agreed that those countries of the Union
where the character of artistic works is not refused to photographs, engage to
admit them to the benefits of the Convention concluded to-day, from the date
of its coming into effect. They are, however, not bound to protect the authors
of such works further than is permitted by their own legislation, except in
the case of international engagements already existing, or which may
hereafter be entered into by them.</i></p>

<p><i>It is understood that an authorised photograph of a protected work of art
shall enjoy legal protection in all the countries of the Union, as contemplated
by the said Convention, for the same period as the principal right of reproduction
of the work itself subsists, and within the limits of private arrangements
between those who have legal rights.</i></p>

<p>2. As regards Article IX. it is agreed that those countries of the Union
whose legislation implicitly includes choregraphic works amongst dramatico-musical
works, expressly admit the former works to the benefits of the
Convention concluded this day.</p>

<p>It is, however, understood that questions which may arise on the
application of this clause shall rest within the competence of the
respective Tribunals to decide.</p>

<p>3. It is understood that the manufacture and sale of instruments
for the mechanical reproduction of musical airs which are copyright,
shall not be considered as constituting an infringement of musical copyright.</p>

<p>4. <i>The common agreement alluded to in Article XIV. of the Convention
is established as follows:</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The application of the Convention to works which have not fallen into
the public domain at the time when it comes into force, shall operate according</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
<i>to the stipulations on this head which may be contained in special Conventions
either existing or to be concluded.</i></p>

<p><i>In the absence of such stipulations between any countries of the Union,
the respective countries shall regulate, each for itself, by its domestic legislation,
the manner in which the principle contained in Article XIV. is to
be applied.</i></p>

<p>5. The organisation of the International Office established in virtue
of Article XVI. of the Convention shall be fixed by a Regulation which
shall be drawn up by the Government of the Swiss Confederation.</p>

<p>The official language of the International Office will be French.</p>

<p>The International Office will collect all kinds of information relative
to the protection of the rights of authors over their literary and artistic
works. It will arrange and publish such information. It will study
questions of general utility likely to be of interest to the Union, and, by
the aid of documents placed at its disposal by the different Administrations,
will edit a periodical publication in the French language treating
questions which concern the Union. The Governments of the countries
of the Union reserve to themselves the faculty of authorising, by common
accord, the publication by the Office of an edition in one or more other
languages if experience should show this to be requisite.</p>

<p>The International Office will always hold itself at the disposal of
members of the Union, with the view to furnish them with any special
information they may require relative to the protection of literary and
artistic works.</p>

<p>The Administration of the country where a Conference is about to be
held, will prepare the programme of the Conference with the assistance
of the International Office.</p>

<p>The Director of the International Office will attend the sittings of the
Conferences, and will take part in the discussions without a deliberative
voice. He will make an annual Report on his administration, which
shall be communicated to all the members of the Union.</p>

<p>The expenses of the Office of the International Union shall be shared
by the Contracting States. Unless a fresh arrangement be made, they
cannot exceed a sum of 60,000 fr. a year. This sum may be increased
by the decision of one of the Conferences provided for in
Article XVII.</p>

<p>The share of the total expense to be paid by each country shall be
determined by the division of the Contracting and acceding States into
six classes, each of which shall contribute in the proportion of a certain
number of units, viz.:</p>

<table summary="Table of the share of the total expense to be paid by each country.">

</table>

<p>These co-efficients will be multiplied by the number of States of each
class, and the total product thus obtained will give the number of units
by which the total expense is to be divided. The quotient will give the
amount of the unity of expense.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span></p>

<p>Each State will declare, at the time of its accession, in which of the
said classes it desires to be placed.</p>

<p>The Swiss Administration will prepare the Budget of the Office,
superintend its expenditure, make the necessary advances, and draw up
the annual account, which shall be communicated to all the other Administrations.</p>

<p>6. The next Conference shall be held at Paris between four and six
years from the date of the coming into force of the Convention.</p>

<p>The French Government will fix the date within these limits after
having consulted the International Office.</p>

<p>7. It is agreed that, as regards the exchange of ratifications contemplated
in Article XXI., each Contracting Party shall give a single
instrument, which shall be deposited, with those of the other States, in
the Government archives of the Swiss Confederation. Each party shall
receive in exchange a copy of the <i>procès-verbal</i> of the exchange of ratifications,
signed by the Plenipotentiaries present.</p>

<p>The present Final Protocol, which shall be ratified with the Convention
concluded this day, shall be considered as forming an integral part
of the said Convention, and shall have the same force, effect, and
duration.</p>

<p>In witness whereof the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed the
same.</p>

<p>Done at Berne, the 9th day of September 1886.</p>

<h4><i>Procès-verbal of Signature.</i></h4>

<p>The undersigned Plenipotentiaries, assembled this day to proceed
with the signature of the Convention with reference to the creation of an
International Union for the protection of literary and artistic works, have
exchanged the following declarations:</p>

<p>1. With reference to the accession of the Colonies or foreign possessions
provided for by Article XIX. of the Convention:</p>

<p>The Plenipotentiaries of His Catholic Majesty the King of Spain
reserve to the Government the power of making known His Majesty's
decision at the time of the exchange of ratifications.</p>

<p>The Plenipotentiary of the French Republic states that the accession
of his country carries with it that of all the French Colonies.</p>

<p>The Plenipotentiaries of Her Britannic Majesty state that the accession
of Great Britain to the Convention for the protection of literary and
artistic works comprises the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,
and all the Colonies and foreign possessions of Her Britannic Majesty.</p>

<p>At the same time they reserve to the Government of Her Britannic
Majesty the power of announcing at any time the separate denunciation
of the Convention by one or several of the following Colonies or possessions,
in the manner provided for by Article XX. of the Convention,
namely:</p>

<p>India, the Dominion of Canada, Newfoundland, the Cape, Natal, New
South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia, Western
Australia, and New Zealand.</p>

<p>2. With respect to the classification of the countries of the Union
having regard to their contributory part to the expenses of the International
Bureau (No. 5 of the Final Protocol):
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span></p>

<p>The Plenipotentiaries declare that their respective countries should be
ranked in the following classes, namely:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Germany in the first class.</span>
<span class="i0">Belgium in the third class.</span>
<span class="i0">Spain in the second class.</span>
<span class="i0">France in the first class.</span>
<span class="i0">Great Britain in the first class.</span>

<span class="i0">Italy in the first class.</span>
<span class="i0">Switzerland in the third class.</span>
<span class="i0">Tunis in the sixth class.</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Liberia states that the powers
which he has received from his Government authorise him to sign the
Convention, but that he has not received instructions as to the class in
which his country proposes to place itself with respect to the contribution
to the expenses of the International Bureau. He, therefore, reserves that
question to be determined by his Government, who will make known
their intention on the exchange of ratifications.</p>

<p>In witness whereof, the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed the
present <i>procès-verbal</i>.</p>

<p>Done at Berne, the 9th day of September 1886.</p>

<p>Whereas the Convention, of which an English translation is set
out in the First Schedule to this Order, has been concluded between Her
Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
and the foreign countries named in this Order, with respect to the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span></p>

<p>Now therefore Her Majesty, by and with the advice of Her Privy
Council, and by virtue of the authority committed to her by the International

as follows:</p>

countries of the Copyright Union shall, subject as in this Order and in
the International Copyright Acts, 1844 to 1886, mentioned, have as
respects that work throughout Her Majesty's dominions the same right
of copyright, including any right capable of being conferred by an Order
in Council under section 2 or section 5 of the International Copyright
Act, 1844, or under any other enactment as if the work had been first
produced in the United Kingdom, and shall have such right during the
same period.</p>

<p>Provided that the author of a literary or artistic work shall not have
any greater right or longer term of copyright therein than that which
he enjoys in the country in which the work is first produced.</p>

<p>The author of any literary or artistic work first produced before the
commencement of this Order shall have the rights and remedies to which
he is entitled under section 6 of the International Copyright Act, 1886.</p>

<p>4. <i>The rights conferred by the International Copyright Acts, 1844 to

subject or citizen of any of the said foreign countries, be limited as follows:
that is to say, the author shall not be entitled to take legal proceedings in Her
Majesty's dominions for protecting any copyright in such work, but the
publisher of such work shall, for the purpose of any legal proceedings in Her
Majesty's dominions for protecting any copyright in such work, be deemed to
be entitled to such copyright as if he were the author, but without prejudice
to the rights of such author and publisher as between themselves.</i></p>

<p>5. A literary or artistic work first produced simultaneously in two or
more countries of the Copyright Union shall be deemed for the purpose
of copyright to have been first produced in that one of those countries
in which the term of copyright in the work is shortest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>

<p>6. Section 6 of the International Copyright Act, 1852, shall not apply

hereby revoked<a id="FNanchor_1783" href="#Footnote_1783" class="fnanchor">[1783]</a>: Provided that neither such revocation, nor anything
else in this Order, shall prejudicially affect any right acquired or accrued
before the commencement of this Order by virtue of any Order hereby
revoked, and any person entitled to such right shall continue entitled
thereto and to the remedies for the same, in like manner as if this Order
had not been made.</p>

<p>8. This Order shall be construed as if it formed part of the International
Copyright Act, 1886.</p>

author shall not have availed himself of it, during a period of ten
years from the date of the first publication of the original work, by

Union, a translation in the language for which protection is to be

Convention and of the present Additional Act.</p>

<p>"(B.) Photographic works and works produced by an analogous
process shall be admitted to the benefits of these engagements in so
far as the laws of each State may permit, and to the extent of the
protection accorded by such laws to similar national works.</p>

<p>"It is understood that an authorised photograph of a work of art
shall enjoy legal protection in all the countries of the Union, as
contemplated by the Berne Convention and by the present Additional
Act, for the same period as the principal right of reproduction of the
work itself subsists, and within the limits of private arrangements
between those who have legal rights."</p>

<p>2. No. 4.&mdash;This clause shall run as follows:</p>

<p>"The common agreement contemplated in Article XIV. of the
Convention is established as follows:</p>

<p>"The application of the Berne Convention and of the present
Additional Act to works which have not fallen into the public
domain within the country of origin at the time when these engagements
come into force, shall operate according to such stipulations on
this head as may be contained in special Conventions either actually
existing or to be concluded hereafter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span></p>

<p>"In the absence of such stipulations between any of the countries
of the Union, the respective countries shall regulate, each for itself,
by its domestic legislation, the manner in which the principle contained
in Article XIV. is to be applied.</p>

<p>"The stipulations of Article XIV. of the Berne Convention and
of the present clause of the Final Protocol shall apply equally to the
exclusive right of translation, in so far as such right is established by
the present Additional Act.</p>

<p>"The temporary stipulations noted above shall be applicable to
countries which may hereafter accede to the Union."</p></blockquote>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article III.</span></h4>

<p>The countries of the Union which are not parties to the present
Additional Act, shall at any time be allowed to accede thereto on their
request to that effect. This stipulation shall apply equally to countries
which may hereafter accede to the Convention of the 9th September
1886. It will suffice for this purpose that such accession should be
notified in writing to the Swiss Federal Council, who shall in turn
communicate it to the other Governments.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Article IV.</span></h4>

<p>The present Additional Act shall have the same force and duration as
the Convention of the 9th September 1886.</p>

<p>It shall be ratified, and the ratifications shall be exchanged at Paris,
in the manner adopted in the case of that Convention, as soon as possible,
and within the space of one year at the latest.</p>

<p>It shall come into force as regards those countries which shall have
ratified it three months after such exchange of ratifications.</p>

<p>In witness whereof the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed the
same, and have affixed thereto the seal of their arms.</p>

<p>Done at Paris in a single transcript, the 4th May 1896.</p>

<h4><i>Procès-Verbal recording Deposit of Ratification.</i></h4>

<p>Circumstances having prevented action being taken within the period
of delay originally fixed for the exchange of the ratifications of the
Additional Act of the 4th May 1896, modifying Articles II., III., V., VII.,
XII., and XX. of the Convention of the 9th September 1886, and clauses
1 and 4 of the Final Protocol annexed thereto, as well as of the
Declaration interpreting certain stipulations of the Convention of Berne
of the 9th September 1886, and of the Additional Act signed at Paris on
the 4th May 1896, it has been unanimously agreed that that period
should be prolonged until this day.</p>

<p>In consequence whereof the Undersigned have met together in order
to deposit the instruments in question.</p>

<p>Germany, Belgium, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco,
Montenegro, Switzerland, and Tunis have ratified both engagements.</p>

<p>Great Britain has ratified the Additional Act alone, on behalf
of the United Kingdom, as well as of all the British Colonies and
Possessions.</p>

<p>Norway has only ratified the interpretative Declaration.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span></p>

<p>The respective ratifications having been produced and found to be in
good and due form, have been handed to the French Minister for
Foreign Affairs, in order that they may be deposited in the archives
of the Ministry, such deposit to be held equivalent to an exchange of
ratifications.</p>

<p>In faith of which the Undersigned have prepared the present Record
of deposit, to which they have affixed their seals.</p>

<p>Done at Paris, the 9th September 1897.</p>

<h3>ORDER IN COUNCIL, <small><span class="smcap">March</span> 7, 1898.</small></h3>

<p>Whereas, &amp;c. (Preamble recites the Berne Convention, 1886, Order
in Council November 28, 1887, other Orders in Council affecting countries
subsequently acceding, and the Additional Act of Paris.)</p>

<p>And whereas Her Majesty in Council is satisfied that the foreign
countries named in the body of this Order and parties to the said
Additional Act have made such provisions as it appears to Her Majesty
expedient to require for the protection of authors of works first produced
in Her Majesty's dominions:</p>

<p>Now therefore Her Majesty, by and with the advice of Her Privy
Council and by virtue of the authority committed to Her by the International
Copyright Acts, 1844 to 1886, doth order, and it is hereby ordered
as follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span></p>

<p>(1.) The Additional Act of the Berne Convention set forth in the
Schedule to this Order shall as from the commencement of this Order
have full effect throughout Her Majesty's dominions, and all persons are
enjoined to observe the same.</p>

<p>(2.) This Order shall extend to the foreign countries following, that is
to say:<a id="FNanchor_1784" href="#Footnote_1784" class="fnanchor">[1784]</a></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Germany,</span>
<span class="i0">Belgium,</span>
<span class="i0">Spain,</span>
<span class="i0">France,</span>
<span class="i0">Italy,</span>
<span class="i0">Luxembourg,</span>
<span class="i0">Monaco,</span>
<span class="i0">Montenegro,</span>
<span class="i0">Switzerland, and</span>
<span class="i0">Tunis.</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>(3.) The fourth article of the Order in Council of November 28,
1887, shall as from the commencement of this Order cease to apply to
the foreign countries to which this Order extends:</p>

<p>(4.) The Order in Council of November 28, 1887, shall continue to be
of full force and effect save in so far as the same is varied by this Order.</p>

<p>(5.) Nothing contained in this Order shall prejudicially affect any
right acquired or accrued before the commencement of this Order by
virtue of the said Order in Council of November 28, 1887, or otherwise,
and any person entitled to such right shall continue entitled thereto and
to the remedies for the same in like manner as if this Order had not been
made.</p>

<p>(6.) The author of any literary or artistic work first produced before the
commencement of this Order shall have the rights and remedies to which
he is entitled under section 6 of The International Copyright Act, 1886.</p>

<p>(7.) This Order shall be construed as if it formed part of The International
Copyright Act, 1886.</p>

<p>(8.) This Order shall come into operation on the date hereof, which day
is in this Order referred to as the commencement of this Order.</p>

<p>And the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury are to give
the necessary orders herein accordingly.</p>

<h3>TREASURY MINUTE</h3>

<h3>TREASURY MINUTE<a id="FNanchor_1785" href="#Footnote_1785" class="fnanchor">[1785]</a> <span class="smcap">Dealing with the Copyright in Government
Publications, August 31, 1887</span>.</h3>

<p>My Lords take into consideration the correspondence which has passed
between the Treasury and the Stationery Office on the subject of Copyright
in Government publications.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
</p>
<p>The law gives to the Crown, or the assignee of the Crown, the same
right of copyright as to a private individual. Consequently, if a servant of
the Crown, in the course of his duty for which he is paid, composes any
document, or if a person is specially employed and paid by the Crown for
the purpose of composing any document, the copyright in the document
belongs to the Crown as it would in the case of a private employer.</p>

<p>The majority of publications issued under the authority of the
Government have no resemblance to the works published by private
publishers, and are published for the information of the public and for
public use, in such manner as any one of the public may wish, and it is
desirable that the knowledge of their contents should be diffused as widely
as possible.</p>

<p>In other cases the Government publishes at considerable cost works in
which few persons only are interested, but which are published for the
purpose of promoting literature and science.</p>

<p>These works are of precisely the same character as those published by
private enterprise.</p>

<p>In order to prevent an undue burden being thrown on the taxpayer by
these works, and to enable the Government to continue the publication
of works of this character to the same extent as heretofore, it is necessary
to place them, as regards copyright, in the same position as publications
by private publishers. If the reproduction of them, or of the most
popular portions of them, by private publishers, is permitted, the private
publisher will be able to put into his own pocket the profits of the work,
which ought to go in relief of the general public, the taxpayers.</p>

<p>The question, then, is, what are the classes of works the reproduction
of which is to be restricted, or to be left unrestricted?</p>

<p>Government publications may be classified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1.) Reports of Select Committees of the two Houses of Parliament,
or of Royal Commissions.</p>

<p>(2.) Papers required by Statute to be laid before Parliament,
<i>e. g.</i>, Orders in Council, Rules made by Government Departments,
Accounts, Reports of Government Inspectors.</p>

<p>(3.) Papers laid before Parliament by Command, <i>e. g.</i>, Treaties,
Diplomatic Correspondence, Reports from Consuls and Secretaries
of Legation, Reports of Inquiries into Explosions or Accidents,
and other Special Reports made to Government Departments.</p>

<p>(4.) Acts of Parliament.</p>

<p>(5.) Official books, <i>e. g.</i>, Queen's Regulations for the Army or
Navy.</p>

<p>(6.) Literary or quasi-literary works, <i>e. g.</i>, the Reports of the
<i>Challenger</i> Expedition, the Rolls Publication, the forthcoming
State Trials, the "Board of Trade Journal."</p>

<p>(7.) Charts and Ordnance Maps.</p></blockquote>

<p>As respects the first five classes of publications, the reproduction of
them, with certain exceptions, should not be restricted in any form
whatever. Indeed, in most cases it is desirable that they should be made
known to the public as widely as possible.</p>

<p>The first exception is, that Acts of Parliament and official books
should not, except when published under the authority of the Government,
purport on the face of them to be published by authority.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span></p>

<p>The second exception is, where a work of a literary or quasi-literary
character comes accidentally within these classes. For example, the
Reports of the Historical Manuscripts Commission would, but for the fact
that they were produced under the direction of a Commission instead
of under the Master of the Rolls, be published in the ordinary manner
like the Rolls publications, and come within Class 6.</p>

<p>So, again, a Report to a Government Department may be laid before
Parliament made by a person of eminent scientific knowledge who is
willing to give the Government and the public the advantage of his knowledge,
but not to allow it to be reproduced for the private benefit of an
individual publisher. Mr. Whitehead's Reports on Injurious Insects are
an instance of this case.</p>

<p>Other exceptions will, no doubt, from time to time occur, which can
only be dealt with as they arise.</p>

<p>As regards the sixth and seventh classes above mentioned, it seems
desirable that the copyright in them should be enforced in the interests of
the taxpayer, and of literature and science. For, as pointed out above,
unless copyright is enforced, cheap copies of the works, or of the popular
portion of them, can be produced by private publishers, who reap the
profit at the expense of the taxpayer. And as such works are in any case
a burden on the taxpayer, the greater the burden the fewer works can the
Government, with justice to the taxpayer, undertake.</p>

<p>Notice of the intention to enforce the copyright in any work should be
given to the public. In the case of future works this notice can be given
by prefixing to the work a notice to the effect that the rights of copyright
are reserved. In the case of past works it will be desirable to inform the
publishing trade of the works the reproduction of which, without
permission, is forbidden.</p>

<p>As respects Acts of Parliament, the Government, in obedience to the
wishes of Parliament expressed by Select Committees, are bound to
publish an edition of them by authority as cheaply as practicable,
and a nearly similar remark applies to official publications. For this
purpose the Comptroller of the Stationery Office shall be appointed Her
Majesty's Printer, but care will be taken not to infringe on any existing
privileges granted by the Crown.</p>

<p>Let instructions be given to the Comptroller of the Stationery Office
and to the Solicitor in pursuance of this Minute.</p>

<h2>ADDENDUM<br />

MUSICAL (SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS) COPYRIGHT ACT, 1902.<br />

<small>2 <span class="smcap">Edw.</span> VII. c. 15.</small></h2>

<p>Since this work went to press the Musical Copyright Bill mentioned on
page 231 has received the Royal Assent and become law. The Act will
come into operation on October 1, 1902, and its application is limited to
the United Kingdom. The Act gives the owner of copyright music
power to seize pirated copies of his works from any person who may
hawk, carry about, sell, or offer for sale the same. To exercise this
power he may proceed in one of two ways. He may apply to a court
of summary jurisdiction, and on <i>primâ facie</i> evidence the court will by
order authorise a constable to seize the alleged pirated copies, or he may
without applying to the court himself authorise a constable in writing to
seize such copies. On the copies being seized by the constable they
must be brought before the court, and on proof that they are pirated
copies the court will order them to be destroyed or delivered to the
owner of the copyright. If the owner authorises the seizure without an
order from the court and fails to prove his case he might be liable in
damages. If, therefore, the owner is not quite sure of his case he should
first obtain the order of the court, which will relieve him from all responsibility,
except costs, in the event of his failing. The Bill as originally
brought into the House of Lords contained a clause empowering
a court of summary jurisdiction to inflict a summary penalty on persons
dealing with pirated music. It also proposed to give the court power to
order a constable to search for pirated music on suspected premises.
These remedies, however, were considered by the House of Commons to
be too drastic and were omitted from the Act.

51 &amp; 52 Vict. c. 17, sec. 3. Wright, J., has held that a knowledge that the music
contained the statutory notice reserving performing rights is not of itself sufficient evidence
that the proprietor knew the performance to be unauthorised. <i>Moul</i> v. <i>Coronet</i>, Nov. 30, 1901.</p></div>

3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 15, sec. 2, provided "double costs of suit." This was amended by
5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 97, sec. 2, to a "full and reasonable indemnity as to all costs, charges, and
expenses." This probably means nothing more than ordinary party and party costs, <i>Reeve</i>
v. <i>Gibson</i> [1891], 1 Q. B., 652; <i>Avery</i> v. <i>Wood</i> [1891], 3 Ch., 115; but it would seem that as
the costs are given by statute they are not in the discretion of the Court, and must be awarded
to a successful plaintiff, <i>Reeve</i> v. <i>Gibson</i> [1891], 1 Q. B., 652; <i>Hasker</i> v. <i>Wood</i> [1885], 54
L. J. Q. B., 419; Judicature Act, 1890, sec. 5. Sec. 2 of 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c. 97 is repealed by the

8 Geo. II. c. 13; 17 Geo. III. c. 57. The above summary is the result of a careful comparison
of these two Acts. As Sir James Stephen says in his "Digest": "They are inexpressibly
puzzling and very cumbrous.... The sense escapes in a cloud of words." It is
submitted, however, that there are more important distinctions between the two Acts than
those noticed in the "Digest," and the above is an attempt to make them as clear as
possible.</p></div>

The whole of section 26 is repealed by the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, in so
far as that Act applies. The result is probably that the first part of the section, printed in
italics, is entirely repealed. The second part of the section is probably not repealed except
in respect of actions against a person or body for acts done in performance of a public duty.</p></div>
